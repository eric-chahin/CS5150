AAS1100;;;Introduction to Asian American Studies;;;3;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;;;;What's in a name? For starters, the contemporary term "Asian Pacific American" has been taxed to hold together in a classificatory embrace a complex, diverse, and rapidly changing population of people of Asian/Pacific descent in the Americas. In this course, we'll track the ongoing adventures of this term "Asian Pacific American" and try to understand how the social and political twists and turns in meaning over the course of its historical journey come to shape individual and collective identities. This interdisciplinary course will introduce students to key ideas and issues in the study of Asian American histories, cultures, and racial formation including, for example, matters of migration, social/cultural/legal citizenship, social movements, and cultural politics. Materials will include films, literature, historical and sociological texts, and media and popular culture texts and productions.
AAS2100;;;South Asian Diaspora;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ANTHR2410;;;This interdisciplinary course (with an emphasis in anthropology) will introduce students to the multiple routes/roots, lived experiences, and imagined worlds of South Asians who have traveled to various lands at different historical moments spanning Fiji, South Africa, Mauritius, Britain, Malaysia, United States, Trinidad, and even within South Asia itself such as the Tamil-speaking population of Sri Lanka. The course will begin with the labor migrations of the 1830s and continue up to the present period. The primary exercise will be to compare and contrast the varied expressions of the South Asian Diaspora globally in order to critically evaluate this transnational identity. Thus, we will ask what, if any, are the ties that bind a fifth-generation Indo-Trinidadian whose ancestor came to the New World as an indentured laborer or "coolie" in the mid-19th century to labor in the cane fields, to a Pakistani medical doctor who migrated to the United States in the late 1980s. If Diaspora violates a sense of identity based on territorial integrity, then could "culture" serve as the basis for a shared identity?

AAS3030;;;Asians in the Americas: A Comparative Perspective;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;AMST3703;ANTHR3703;;;The common perception of ethnicity is that it is a "natural" and an inevitable consequence of cultural difference. "Asians" overseas, in particular, have won repute as a people who cling tenaciously to their culture and refuse to assimilate into their host societies and cultures. But, who are the "Asians?" On what basis can we label "Asians" an ethnic group? Although there is a significant Asian presence in the Caribbean, the category "Asian" itself does not exist in the Caribbean. What does this say about the nature of categories that label and demarcate groups of people on the basis of alleged cultural and phenotypical characteristics? This course will examine the dynamics behind group identity, namely ethnicity, by comparing and contrasting the multicultural experience of Asian populations in the Caribbean and the United States. Ethnographic case studies will focus on the East Indian and Chinese experiences in the Caribbean and the Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Filipino, and Indian experiences in the United States.

AIS2660;;;Everything You Know About Indians is Wrong: Unlearning Native American History;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(D);;;;;;AMST2660;HIST2660;;;One thing many Americans think they know is their Indians: Pocahontas, the First Thanksgiving, fighting cowboys, reservation poverty, and casino riches. Under our very noses, however, Native American history has evolved into one of the most exciting, dynamic, and contentious fields of inquiry into America's past. It is now safer to assume, as Comanche historian Paul Chaat Smith has pointed out, that everything you know about Indians is in fact wrong. Most people have much to "unlearn" about Native American history before true learning can take place. This course aims to achieve that end by (re)introducing students to key themes and trends in the history of North America's indigenous nations. Employing an issues-oriented approach, the course stresses the ongoing complexity of Native American societies' engagements with varieties of settler colonialism since 1492 and dedicates itself to a concerted program of myth-busting. As such, the course will provide numerous opportunities for students to develop their critical thinking and reading skills.

AMST1500;;;An Introduction to Africana Studies: Blackness in Global and Transnational Perspective;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ASRC1500;GOVT1503;;;At the inception of this department at Cornell University in 1969, the ASRC became the birthplace of Africana studies and is now an institution increasingly defining the "new Africana studies." Africana studies is a discipline that has been increasingly universalized in academia and that emphasizes comparative and interdisciplinary studies of Africa, the U.S., the Caribbean and other diasporas.  In this course, we will look at the diverse contours of the discipline and draw on resources from the humanities and social sciences. We will explore contexts ranging from modernity and the Trans-Atlantic slave trade and plantation complex in the New World to processes of decolonization and globalization. Within this framework, we will also consider the concept of race and notions of racial formation and newer concepts such as "post-blackness." We will consider how blackness as a concept shapes cultural flows and exchanges in the global context and saliently impacts popular culture. Topics that we will explore include history, literature, music, art, education, politics, religion, economics, health and the prison industrial complex.
AMST1581;;;America at War to 1898;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;HIST1581;;;This course propels students into the chaos, destruction, and often brutal violence experienced by inhabitants of North America prior to the 20th century. Students will analyze armed conflict and its relationship to the history of human societies in North America from 10,000 B.C.E. (the beginnings of recorded human warfare) to 1898 (the commencement of American efforts to project its military strength into the wider world). Key themes of the course include: pre-contact indigenous warfare and its legacies in conflicts between indigenous nations and intruding settler societies; imperial contests for control over North American territory and resources; the creation of the United States' military institutions and the role of warfare in shaping the American nation-state; the relationship between the "winning of the west" during the late nineteenth century and the origins of American military interventions abroad; and the contrast between an understanding of warfare as a lived human experience and its memorialization through writing, reporting, commemoration, debating, and myth-making.
AMST1600;;;Introduction to American Indian Studies I: Indigenous North America;;;3;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;AIS1100;;;This course provides an interdisciplinary introduction to the diverse cultures, histories and contemporary situations of the Indigenous peoples of North America. Students will also be introduced to important themes in the post-1492 engagement between Indigenous and settler populations in North America and will consider the various and complex ways in which that history affected - and continues to affect - American Indian peoples and societies. Course materials draw on the humanities, social sciences, and expressive arts.
AMST1601;;;Introduction to American Indian Studies II: Indigenous Issues in Global Perspectives;;;3;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;AIS1110;;;This course attends to the contemporary issues, contexts and experiences of Indigenous peoples. Students will develop a substantive understanding of colonialism and engage in the parallels and differences of its histories, forms, and effects on Indigenous peoples globally.  Contemporary Indigenous theorists, novelists, visual artists and historians have a prominent place in the course, highlighting social/environmental philosophies, critical responses to and forms of resistance toward neocolonial political and economic agendas and the fundamental concern for Indigenous self determination, among other topics.
AMST1800;;;Immigration in U.S. History;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;HIST1800;LSP1800;;;This course examines immigration as a major theme in U.S. history and culture. We will discuss immigration in different periods of our national history, and in different locations, from Boston and New York to San Diego, San Francisco, and Honolulu. We will also examine these migrations in a global context since they were part of a worldwide migration that affected millions of people. Lectures, readings, and discussions will examine popular, legal, and political responses to immigration, as reflected in legislation and policy, as well as film, art, literature, and the print media.
AMST2000;;;Introduction to Visual Studies;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;ARTH2000;COML2000;VISST2000;;;Provides a broad introduction of modes of vision and the historical impact of visual images, visual structures, and visual space on culture, communication, and politics. The question of "how we see" is discussed in terms of (1) procedures of sight (from optical machines to the psychology of vision and the philosophy of aesthetics); (2) spaces of vision (from landscapes to maps to cities); (3) objects of vision (from sacred sites to illuminated books to digital art); and (4) performances of vision (race, sexualities, ethnicities, cultures). Of importance to the course is the practical and conceptual relation of 20th-century visual technologies (photography, cinema, video, and computing) to their historical corollaries in the arts. The course draws on the visual traditions of both Western and non-Western societies and study texts that have defined the premises and analytic vocabularies of the visual. Through viewings, screenings, collaborative writing, and art projects, students develop the critical skills necessary to appreciate how the approaches that define visual studies complicate traditional models of defining and analyzing art objects. Guest lecturers occasionally address the class. Requirements: two objective midterm exams; occasional listserve postings; two five-page papers.
AMST2001;;;The First American University;;;1;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;ENGL2999;HIST2005;;;Educational historian Frederick Rudolph called Cornell University "the first American university," referring to its unique role as a coeducational, nonsectarian, land-grant institution with a broad curriculum and diverse student body. In this course, we will explore the history of Cornell, taking as our focus the pledge of Ezra Cornell and Andrew Dickson White to found a university where "any person can find instruction in any study." The course will cover a wide range of topics and perspectives relating to the faculty, student body, evolution of campus, and important events and eras in Cornell history. Stories and vignettes will provide background on the current university and its administrative structure, campus traditions, and the names that adorn buildings and memorials throughout campus. Finally, the course will offer a forum for students to address questions on present-day aspects of the university.
AMST2003;;;Creating Contemporary Cornell;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;GOVT2002;HIST2501;;;Creating Contemporary Cornell will examine the history of Cornell from 1945-Present.

AMST2006;;;Punk Culture: The Aesthetics and Politics of Refusal;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;COML2006;ENGL2006;MUSIC2006;;;Punk Culture-comprised of music, fashion, literature, and visual arts-represents a complex critical stance of resistance and refusal that coalesced at a particular historical moment in the mid-1970s, and continues to be invoked, revived, and revised. In this course we will explore punk's origins in New York and London, U.S. punk's regional differences (the New York scene's connection to the art and literary worlds, Southern California's skate and surf culture, etc.), its key movements (hardcore, straight edge, riot grrrl, crust, queercore), its race, class and gender relations, and its ongoing influence on global youth culture. We will read, listen, and examine a variety of visual media to analyze how punk draws from and alters previous aesthetic and political movements.
AMST2030;;;Introduction to American Literatures: Beginnings to the Civil War;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;ENGL2030;;;This course begins with a look at the philosophies of the first Americans, Native Americans, using the example of the Navajo creation narratives, and then proceeds to read European, African American, and other Native texts in order to understand what forces shaped the formation of the United States and pulled it apart by the time of the Civil War. We will be particularly interested in the forces of colonialism, capitalism, and democracy, through the readings of such documents as the journals of Christopher Columbus; the Indian captivity narratives of Mary Rowlandson and Mary Jemison; the political writings of Tom Paine, James Madison, Thomas Jefferson, and Henry David Thoreau; narratives of African American resistance by David Walker, Harriet Jacobs, and Frederick Douglass; the Pequot William Apess's writings for the rights of American Indians; and the fiction of Harriet Beecher Stowe and Herman Melville.
AMST2040;;;Introduction to American Literature: Civil War to the Present;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;ENGL2040;;;This course will introduce students to American literature from the Civil War to the present. We will consider a wide range of authors and literary movements while paying close attention to radical shifts in American culture in the past century and a half. We will ask: What traditions do American authors inherit and what new ones do they invent? How does this writing engage central issues of modern American culture such as race, immigration, class mobility, and technology? The class will examine a variety of genres including poetry, novels, manifestos, and drama. Authors include Mark Twain, Kate Chopin, T.S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, William Faulkner, Felipe Alfau, Langston Hughes, Allen Ginsberg, Thomas Pynchon, Toni Morrison, and others.
AMST2060;;;The Great American Cornell Novel;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;ENGL2060;;;Some of the best novels of the last 50 years were written by people who were students or professors at Cornell. Reading a selection of these great Cornell novels, we will also be tracing the history and development of post-WWII American fiction. Readings will include classic works by V. Nabokov, R. Farina, T. Pynchon, W. Gass, J. Russ and T. Morrison, as well as several more recent (some very recent) works by your fellow Cornellians. Perhaps in a few years your work will be on the list.
AMST2105;;;The American Musical;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;ENGL2150;MUSIC2250;PMA2650;;;The musical is a distinct and significant form of American performance. This course will consider the origins, development, and internationalization of the American musical and will emphasize the interpenetration of the history of musical theatre with the history of the United States in the 20th century and beyond. We will investigate how political, social, and economic factors shape the production of important American musicals-and how, in turn, musicals shape expressions of personal identity and national ideology. Key texts include Oklahoma, Guys and Dolls, West Side Story, Hair, and Rent.
AMST2220;;;From the New Deal to the Age of Reagan;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;HIST2220;;;This seminar will explore some of the major political and cultural trends in the United States,  from the era of the Democratic New Dealer, Franklin D. Roosevelt, through the era of the conservative Republican, Ronald Reagan? This seminar will explore through primary source research and secondary readings  the key economic, political, and cultural characteristics and transformations of the period from 1930 though the turn of the century.  The course will examine the rise, persistence, and breakdown of the so-called "New Deal Order" and the crucial political shifts that we call the "Reagan Revolution." A key theme in this course will be the transformations and critiques of American liberalism and conservatism.
AMST2251;;;U.S. Immigration Narratives;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;HIST2251;LSP2251;;;Americans are conflicted about immigration.  We honor and celebrate (and commercialize) our immigrant heritage in museums, folklife festivals, parades, pageants, and historical monuments. We also build fences and detention centers, and pass more and more laws to bar access to the United States. Polls tell us that Americans are concerned about the capacity of the United States to absorb so many immigrants from around the world. How often have we heard the laments "Today's immigrants are too different. They don't want to assimilate" or "My grandparents learned English quickly, why can't they?" The assumption is that older generations 'Americanized' quickly but that today's immigrants do not want to assimilate. Did 19th century immigrants really migrate to the United States to "become Americans"? Did they really assimilate quickly? Are today's immigrants really all that different from the immigrants who arrived earlier? Why do these particular narratives have such power and currency? This seminar will explore these issues and help students discern fact from fiction.
AMST2260;;;Music of the 1960s;;;3;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ASRC2260;MUSIC2260;;;In this class, we will examine how musicians working in such genres as rock, jazz, folk, classical, soul, and experimental music responded and contributed to the major themes of the 1960s in the US: the counterculture, Vietnam, the civil rights movement, women's liberation, and the space race. We will examine written texts, recordings, and films from the period. The ability to read music is not required.
AMST2331;;;Agriculture, History, and Society: From Squanto to Biotechnology;;;3;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;STS2331;;;Surveys the major themes in the development of agriculture and agribusiness in the United States in the 19th and 20th centuries. These include particular individuals (e.g., Liberty Hyde Bailey, Luther Burbank, G. W. Carver, Henry A. Wallace, and Norman Borlaug), the rise of government support and institutions (including U.S.D.A. and Cornell), noteworthy events (the dust bowl, World War II, and the environmental movement), and the achievements of the Green and "Gene" Revolutions.
AMST2352;;;Paul Robeson and the Revolutionary Imagination;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;ASRC2352;HIST2352;;;Radical activist and artist Paul Robeson was one of the most beloved and persecuted black men in American history. His life, writing, artistic production, and iconic image helped shape political and artistic movements in the U.S. and beyond from the 1930s to the 1950s. Robeson was not only the first black man to play Othello on Broadway, he was also a key figure in black freedom movements, anticolonial movements, and labor movements in the first half of the twentieth century. From the Popular Front era of the 1930s through the arid political climate of the 1950s, Robeson's activism inspired, propelled, and expanded freedom movements in the U.S. and abroad. This course will examine Robeson's life as a way of understanding those movements.
AMST2560;;;Waiting for Superman? Perspectives on the Crisis in American K-12 Education;;;3;;;;;;;;;;;;PAM2550;;;This course examines the widespread perception and the varied responses to the notion that the American K-12 education system is failing to adequately prepare its students. We review the structure of the U.S. K-12 education system, the role of government in school finance and oversight, and its performance in historical and international context. With this background, we review evidence on a large array of school reforms currently in vogue, including increases in funding, teacher training and recruitment, school autonomy (charter schools), student and teacher accountability, and improving incentives for teacher and student performance.
AMST2581;;;Environmental History;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;BSOC2581;HIST2581;;;This lecture course serves as an introduction to the historical study of humanity's interrelationship with the natural world. Environmental history is a quickly evolving field, taking on increasing importance as the environment itself becomes increasingly important in world affairs. During this semester, we'll examine the sometimes unexpected ways in which "natural" forces have shaped human history (the role of germs, for instance, in the colonization of North America); the ways in which human beings have shaped the natural world (through agriculture, urbanization, and industrialization, as well as the formation of things like wildlife preserves); and the ways in which cultural, scientific, political, and philosophical attitudes toward the environment have changed over time. This is designed as an intensely interdisciplinary course: we'll view history through the lenses of ecology, literature, art, film, law, anthropology, and geography. Our focus will be on the United States, but, just as environmental pollutants cross borders, so too will this class, especially toward the end, when we attempt to put U.S. environmental history into a geopolitical context. This course is meant to be open to all, including non-majors and first-year students.
AMST2600;;;Introduction to American Indian Literature;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;AIS2600;ENGL2600;;;Both oral and written, Native literatures of the U.S. comprise a critical commentary on a range of ongoing issues facing the international community: the environment, sustainability, gender, capitalism, and colonialism. This course will discuss these issues from a Native perspective in fiction, poetry, non-fiction, and traditional oral narratives, ranging from before the European invasion of the Americas (1492) to the present, where  since the 1960s Native writers have been winning distinguished literary awards such as the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award.
AMST2620;;;Introduction to Asian American Literature;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;AAS2620;ENGL2620;;;This course will introduce both a variety of writings by Asian North American authors and some critical issues concerning the production and reception of Asian American texts. Working primarily with novels, we will be asking questions about the relation between literary forms and the socio-historical context within which they take on their meanings, and about the historical formation of Asian American identities.
AMST2640;;;Introduction to Asian American History;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;AAS2130;HIST2640;;;An introductory history of Chinese, Japanese, Asian Indians, Filipinos, and Koreans in the United States from the mid-nineteenth century to the 1990s. Major themes include racism and resistance, labor migration, community formation, imperialism, and struggles for equality.
AMST2650;;;Introduction to African American Literature;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ASRC2650;ENGL2650;;;This course will introduce students to the African American literary tradition. Through aesthetic and contextual approaches, we will consider how African American life and culture has defined and constituted the United States of America. From slave narratives to Hip-Hop music, we will trace the range of artistic conventions and cultural movements while paying close attention to broader historical shifts in American life over the past three centuries. We will ask: How do authors create and define a tradition? What are some of the recurring themes and motifs within this tradition? Authors will include: Phillis Wheatley, David Walker, Frederick Douglass, Ida B. Wells-Barnett, W.E.B. DuBois, Zora Neal Hurston, Lorraine Hansberry, James Baldwin, Audre Lorde, Toni Morrison, and Paul Beatty.
AMST2655;;;Latinos in the United States;;;3-4;;;Spring.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;DSOC2650;LSP2010;SOC2650;;;Exploration and analysis of the Hispanic experience in the United States. Examines the sociohistorical background and economic, psychological, and political factors that converge to shape a Latino group identity in the United States. Perspectives are suggested and developed for understanding Hispanic migrations, the plight of Latinos in urban and rural areas, and the unique problems faced by the diverse Latino groups. Groups studied include Mexican Americans, Dominicans, Cubans, and Puerto Ricans.
AMST2660;;;Everything You Know About Indians is Wrong: Unlearning Native American History;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;AIS2660;HIST2660;;;One thing many Americans think they know is their Indians: Pocahontas, the First Thanksgiving, fighting cowboys, reservation poverty, and casino riches. Under our very noses, however, Native American history has evolved into one of the most exciting, dynamic, and contentious fields of inquiry into America's past. It is now safer to assume, as Comanche historian Paul Chaat Smith has pointed out, that everything you know about Indians is in fact wrong. Most people have much to "unlearn" about Native American history before true learning can take place. This course aims to achieve that end by (re)introducing students to key themes and trends in the history of North America's indigenous nations. Employing an issues-oriented approach, the course stresses the ongoing complexity of Native American societies' engagements with varieties of settler colonialism since 1492 and dedicates itself to a concerted program of myth-busting. As such, the course will provide numerous opportunities for students to develop their critical thinking and reading skills.
AMST2675;;;Cultures of the Cold War;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;ENGL2675;;;This class aims to approach the literature and culture of the Cold War as the birth of the present "Age of Information," as well as the origin of modern notions of privacy that are now being superseded. We will begin with Hiroshima and the several forms of American anti-communism, and proceed from "containment culture" to the beginning of the counterculture, and from atomic weapons to the start of the environmental movement. Units of study will include intelligence (espionage), advertising (publicity), civil rights, and the public questioning of gender roles.  We will also view a few films and discuss music and painting of the period.  Authors include James Baldwin, Sylvia Plath, Marshall McLuhan, John Okada, Jack Kerouac, Frank O'Hara, Patricia Highsmith, and Rachel Carson.
AMST2680;;;Culture and Politics of the 1960s;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ENGL2680;;;Nearly half a century ago, the civil rights movement, the Cold War, and Vietnam stimulated critiques and alternative lifestyles that changed American society forever. What can the experiences of young "boomers" who lived through the 1960s teach a later generation living through similar crises and hopes? This interdisciplinary course combines an historical overview with the close reading of texts, concentrating on racial justice, war, the counterculture, the New Left, the women's movement, and gay and lesbian rights. Texts will include The Autobiography of Malcolm X, Kubrick's film Dr. Strangelove, Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five, music of Dylan and Joplin, speeches of King, manifestos, memoirs, and poems.
AMST2710;;;Social and Political Context of American Education;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;AMST5710;DSOC2710;DSOC5710;EDUC2710;EDUC5710;SOC2710;SOC5710;;;This course is a blending of the Sociology of Education and Public Policy. Front and center in this course is the question of why consistent differential educational and economic outcomes exists in American society. We explore the broad sociological functions of schooling (socialization, sorting, caretaking, training) as well as local, state, and federal policies and court decisions.
AMST3010;;;Photography and the American Dream;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ARTH3010;VISST3010;;;Who are 'the poor' in the United States? Who are the largest recipients of federal welfare and entitlement spending? Why is there an unprecedented simultaneous increase in wealth and poverty in the United States at this point in its history? What role does photography play in our understanding and misunderstanding of poverty in 'the greatest country in the world?' In this course we will explore the perceptions of poverty in the United States through three major American newspapers.
AMST3020;;;Representing Brooklyn: Race, Place and Popular Culture;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ANTHR3020;ASRC3020;;;Hip Hop Brooklyn. Hipster Brooklyn. Immigrant Brooklyn. Brownstone Brooklyn. While today Brooklyn is New York City's hippest borough and the site of swift gentrification, booming real estate, and the ever-escalating displacement of immigrant and Black communities, in the 1980s and 1990s it was a hotbed of hip hop music, making the borough synonymous with Black cultural production. New York's most populous borough is still the home of the nation's most concentrated Black population. This course borrows from hip hop's notion of "representing" to explore popular and cultural understandings of race and place in Brooklyn as depicted in print, music, and film. How is Brooklyn represented? What do these representations reveal about Black cultural production, inequality and transnational identity formation more broadly speaking? Spanning the period from 1945 to the present day, emphases will include the grassroots movements of the 1960s-1970s, the commodification of hip hop in the 1980s-1990s, and close readings of iconic Brooklyn films such as Spike Lee's "Do the Right Thing," to reflect on how Black popular culture engages with Brooklyn's many ethnic groups. While materials are interdisciplinary in approach, our investigation is informed by anthropological, historical, and literary texts covering topics including immigration, transnationalism, gentrification, and gendered and racialized inequality. Texts include Marshall's Brown Girl, Brownstones; Mose Brown's Raising Brooklyn: Nannies, Childcare, and Caribbeans in Creating Community; Bailey's Jay-Z: Essays on Hip Hop's Philosopher King; Osman's The Invention of Brownstone Brooklyn: Gentrification and the Search for Authenticity in Postwar New York; and LaBennett's She's Mad Real: Popular Culture and West Indian Girls in Brooklyn.
AMST3032;;;Race and Revolution in the Americas: 1776-1900;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;ASRC3031;HIST3031;LATA3031;;;This course will examine the "age of democratic revolutions" in the Americas from the perspective of the Black Atlantic. During this momentous era, when European monarchies were successfully challenged and constitutional governments created, Blacks fomented their own American revolutions both in the outside of evolving "New World democracies." This course examines the black trajectory in British North America, Latin America, the French (especially Haiti,) the British and the Spanish Caribbean. The course begins with black participation in the U.S. independence War (1776-1781) and concludes with black (non-U.S.) participation in the independence wars against Spain. The course will also briefly address post-emancipation race relations in these American countries.
AMST3060;;;Recent History of American Workers;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;ILRLR3060;;;Focuses on the social history of American workers and the role of organized labor in American life since the 1960s. Course themes often center on the complexities of social class in the United States. Topics include the transformations of liberalism, the civil rights and black power movements, the Vietnam War, the rise and fall of the New Left, industrial restructuring, the rise of neoconservatism, changes in civic identity, and sources of cultural conflict. Course ends with an examination of globalization, changes in the major political parties, the future of work, and prospects for social change.
AMST3065;;;Immigrant America: Race and Citizenship in Modern Working-Class History;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;ILRLR3065;LATA3065;LSP3065;;;Immigration discourse and policy has played a central role in shaping the modern American nation-state, including its composition, values, and institutions. This course begins in the late nineteenth century, defining it as a pivotal moment in U.S. immigration and labor history when efforts to regulate immigrant entry and naturalization became increasingly bureaucratized. As part of the course we will examine the causes and consequences of working-class migration to the United States from a comparative historical, ethno-racial, class-based, and gendered perspective. We will also address questions regarding the perceived benefit and cost of immigration at both the national and local (i.e., community) levels. In this sense, we will explore the economic, social, cultural, and political impact immigrants have had on the United States over time. Finally, we will consider how immigrants have negotiated the pressures of their new surroundings, and challenged dominant conceptions of American national identity and citizenship in the process.
AMST3131;;;The Nature, Functions, and Limits of Law;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;GOVT3131;LAW4131;;;A general-education course to acquaint students with how our legal system pursues the goals of society. The course introduces students to various perspectives on the nature of law, what functions it ought to serve in society, and what it can and cannot accomplish. The course proceeds in the belief that such matters constitute a valuable and necessary part of a general education, not only for pre-law students but especially for students in other fields. Assigned readings comprise legal materials and also secondary sources on the legal process and the role of law in society. The classes include discussion and debate about current legal and social issues, including equality, safety, the environment, punishment, and autonomy.
AMST3140;;;U.S. in the World;;;4;;;Fall, summer.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;CAPS3140;HIST3140;;;Students examine the emergence of the United States as a world power in the twentieth century. The course focuses on the domestic sources of foreign policy and the assumptions of the major policy makers (Wilson through Clinton). Important themes include the American response to a revolutionary world since 1912, the role of American racial views in the making of foreign policy, and the increasingly dominant role of the president in the making of U.S. foreign policy.
AMST3142;;;Incarceration, Policy Response, and Self-Reflection;;;3-4;;;Spring.;;;(SBA-AS);;;Prerequisite: Participation as a Teaching Assistant in the CPEP program in Auburn or Cayuga or work in a juvenile or other correctional facility.;;;GOVT3142;;;This class is intended to provoke some hard thinking about the relationship of committed "outsiders" and advocates of change to the experience of crime, punishment, and incarceration and to the men we meet at Auburn/Cayuga who have been in most instances long-confined to prison. We will read, think, talk and write about the incarceration experience and about policies that shape this experience. We will also think self-reflexively about the character of the 'outsider's' educational, political, and personal engagement.   What are the motivations and what are the goals of such engagement? What are the anticipated outcomes - personal, social, educational, political, and/or moral and perhaps spiritual? In an effort to delve deeply into these questions, we will read a broad selection of work on incarceration, itself, as well as on the experience of what has come to be termed service learning or civic engagement.
AMST3200;;;Historical Archaeology;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;AMST6210;ANTHR3210;ANTHR6210;ARKEO3210;ARKEO6210;;;Historical archaeology attempts to bring textual and archaeological data to bear on questions of the past. In practice this can mean many different approaches, including some that are not traditionally termed "historical archaeology". This course explores the range of such efforts, asking questions like, What kinds of sites/contexts/data are amenable? What are the implications of the term "historical archaeology" itself? What has been and can be learned using these approaches?
AMST3230;;;American Economic History I;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(SBA-AS);;;Prerequisite: ECON 1110-ECON 1120 or equivalent.;;;ECON3310;;;Surveys problems in American economic history from the first settlements to early industrialization. NOTE: Formerly ECON 3230.
AMST3281;;;Constitutional Politics: The U.S. Supreme Court;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;GOVT3281;LAW3281;;;This course investigates the United States Supreme Court and its role in politics and government.

Discussed are major constitutional law decisions, their political contexts, and the social and behavioral factors that affect judges, justices, and federal court jurisprudence.
AMST3330;;;Ways of Knowing: Indigenous and Local Ecological Knowledge;;;3;;;Fall.;;;(KCM-AS);;;;;;AIS3330;NTRES3330;NTRES6330;;;Based on indigenous and local "ways of knowing," this course (1) presents a theoretical and humanistic framework from which to understand generation of ecological knowledge; (2) examines processes by which to engage indigenous and local knowledge of natural resources, the nonhuman environment, and human-environment interactions; and (3) reflects upon the relevance of this knowledge to climatic change, resource extraction, food sovereignty, and issues of sustainability and conservation.
AMST3360;;;American Drama and Theatre;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;ENGL3360;PMA3757;;;Explores major American playwrights from 1900 to 1960, introducing students to American theatre as a significant part of modern American cultural history. We will consider the ways in which theatre has contributed to the construction and deconstruction of a national identity. Similarly, we will examine the influence of the American Theatre on and in film. We will pay special attention to the social, political, and aesthetic contexts of the time period and discuss the shifting popularity of dramatic forms, including melodrama, realism, expressionism, absurdism, and the folk play, in the American theatre canon. Authors include O'Neill, Glaspell, Odets, Rice, Hellman, Hughes, Miller, Williams, and Albee, among others.
AMST3380;;;Urban Inequality;;;4;;;;;;;;;;;;SOC3380;;;This is a seminar course on urban inequality in the United States.  The first half of the semester will be dedicated to understanding the political, historical, and social determinants of inequality in America's cities. Politically and socially, cities face unique challenges. Municipalities lack much formal authority to resolve issues that arise within their borders, and their populations are highly heterogeneous in terms of ethnicity, race, and social class. In the second half of the course, we will investigate a number of contemporary facets of urban inequality in-depth, such as residential segregation, urban schooling, immigration, and suburban sprawl.
AMST3402;;;Being and Becoming Black;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ANTHR3400;ASRC3400;LSP3400;;;This course is about being Black throughout the Atlantic world. What constitutes Blackness? What experiences, cultural understandings and social problems shape the identities of people of African descent? In order to address these questions, the course focuses on the people who were relocated by the Atlantic slave trade to the Caribbean, South and Central America, and the United States, and on their subsequent migrations. We will explore the disparate cultural, national, historical and intellectual contexts in which Black identities are constructed, revealing both commonalities and differences. Paying specific attention to how racial identity is shaped by social context, the course will interrogate theories of Black identity formation and notions of Black nationhood, and will examine different perspectives on Diaspora theory. While readings are interdisciplinary in approach, our understandings of Blacks in the Atlantic world will be informed by ethnographic, historical and literary texts covering many cultural contexts including the U.S., England, Kenya, South Africa, Haiti, Puerto Rico, Brazil, Jamaica and the Dominican Republic. Students are urged to choose research topics early in the term from a variety of subjects including music, fashion, religion, literature, politics, sports, etc.
AMST3405;;;Multicultural Issues in Education;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ANTHR3405;EDUC3405;LSP3405;;;This course explores research on race, ethnicity and language in American education.

AMST3470;;;Asian American Women's History;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;AAS3470;FGSS3470;HIST3470;;;This course examines the experiences and representations of Asian American women from the mid-19th century to the present. It explores the lives and contexts of immigrant women and of women born in the U.S. Questions of identity and power are at the heart of this course as we investigate the intertwined nature of race, gender, and nation. We will also pay particular attention to the practice of history, seeking a better understanding of how scholars recover the history of a population rendered invisible by traditional methods and inquiries. Course materials include numerous primary sources in addition to scholarship from a variety of disciplines (history, literature, sociology, anthropology).
AMST3515;;;Blaxploitation Film and Photography;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;ARTH3505;ASRC3505;FGSS3505;PMA3505;VISST3505;;;Blaxploitation films of the 1970s are remembered for their gigantic Afros, enormous guns, slammin' soundtracks, sex, drugs, nudity, and violence. Never before or since have so many African American performers been featured in starring roles. Macho male images were projected alongside strong, yet sexually submissive female ones. But how did these images affect the roles that black men and women played on and off the screen and the portrayal of the black body in contemporary society? This interdisciplinary course explores the range of ideas and methods used by critical thinkers in addressing the body in art, film, photography and the media. We will consider how the display of the black body affects how we see and interpret the world by examining the construction of beauty, fashion, hairstyles and gendered images as well as sexuality, violence, race, and hip-hop culture.
AMST3525;;;Twentieth Century American Poetry;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;ENGL3525;;;Twentieth-century poetry has been closely identified with what Ezra Pound famously termed the challenge to "Make It New." Yet the question of just what "making it new" might mean was hotly contested throughout the century. Why did poets feel the need to make it new? What did making it new mean to people entering the institution of "poetry" from different social positions? American poetry diversified as it also rose in international influence. We will look at a number of different forms of poetry developed by poets from the United States, not forgetting to note the extent to which "Americanism" was or was not of concern to them in their experiments.
AMST3560;;;Modeling Race, Fashioning Beauty;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ASRC3550;FGSS3540;;;Using written and visual biographies as a starting point, this class follows African and African American women in the fashion industry to explore perceptions of beauty, race, gender and class. Contemporary television, global fashion and rigorous cultural studies will be intertwined as students discuss cultural standards of beauty, and ultimately, compose self-narratives defining their own relationship with fashion, appearance and self-image.
AMST3581;;;Imaginative Arts of Migration;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;COML3580;GERST3581;PMA3481;VISST3581;;;What role should imaginative arts play in debates about transnational migration, one of the principal factors re-shaping community and communication today?  Focusing on literature and film from the late 20th and early 21st centuries, with primary examples drawn from Germany, France and the United States-in relation to Turkey, Hungary, Tunisia, Iran, Nigeria, China, Mexico, and Japan-this course explores how creative arts rework the fabric of social life affected by migration.  Seminar-style discussion of assigned readings and viewings, with occasional lectures on other arts and regions.  Thematic units organized around key concepts such as borders and movement, ethnoscapes and citizenship, reading and viewing, labor and leisure, cityscapes and place-making, mediascapes and personhood, lawfulness and illegality, language and speech, art and perception.
AMST3590;;;The Black Radical Tradition in the U.S.;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;ASRC3590;HIST3590;;;This course provides a critical historical interrogation of what Black Marxism author Cedric Robinson called "the Black Radical Tradition." It is designed to introduce students to some of the major currents in the history of black radical thought, action and organizing, with an emphasis on the United States after World War I. It relies on social, political and intellectual history to examine the efforts of black people who have sought not merely social reform, but a fundamental restructuring of political, economic and social relations. We will define and evaluate radicalism in the shifting contexts of liberation struggles. We will explore dissenting visions of social organization and alternative definitions of citizenship, progress and freedom. We will confront the meaning of the intersection of race, gender, class and sexuality in social movements.
AMST3605;;;U.S. Art from FDR to Reagan;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;ARTH3605;;;Considers the contextual features of American art from the 1930s through the late 1980s.

AMST3672;;;Visualizing el Barrio: Interpreting and Documenting East Harlem's Mural Tradition;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ARTH3670;ENGL3672;LSP3672;VISST3670;;;Visualizing El Barrio immerses students in a semester-long contemplation and class project that integrates artistic praxis with art history and literary studies to document the historical murals of East Harlem, otherwise known as Spanish Harlem or "El Barrio."  These murals tell stories about people, places, and events that resonate with El Barrio's predominantly Latino/a community and American culture more broadly.  The murals in East Harlem emerge out of a rich Latin American artistic tradition that migrated with the people who comprise the U.S. Latino/a diaspora. Through student research and documentation, "Visualizing El Barrio" will also participate in the preservation of East Harlem's historical murals, culminating in a celebration of the artwork with a student-curated exhibit of photographs and presentations.
AMST3690;;;The Race and Gender of Poverty in Literature and Film;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ENGL3690;FGSS3691;;;Poverty is an ongoing issue in the United States, and has intensified since the recession of 2008. As such, poverty has disproportionately affected women and underrepresented racial and ethnic communities. This course will analyze this issue through its representation in film and literature, both fiction and non-fiction.
AMST3703;;;Asians in the Americas: A Comparative Perspective;;;4;;;;;;;;;;;;AAS3030;ANTHR3703;;;The common perception of ethnicity is that it is a "natural" and an inevitable consequence of cultural difference. "Asians" overseas, in particular, have won repute as a people who cling tenaciously to their culture and refuse to assimilate into their host societies and cultures. But, who are the "Asians?" On what basis can we label "Asians" an ethnic group? Although there is a significant Asian presence in the Caribbean, the category "Asian" itself does not exist in the Caribbean. What does this say about the nature of categories that label and demarcate groups of people on the basis of alleged cultural and phenotypical characteristics? This course will examine the dynamics behind group identity, namely ethnicity, by comparing and contrasting the multicultural experience of Asian populations in the Caribbean and the United States. Ethnographic case studies will focus on the East Indian and Chinese experiences in the Caribbean and the Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Filipino, and Indian experiences in the United States.
AMST3740;;;Painting Nineteenth Century America;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;Recommended prerequisite: ARTH 2400, VISST 2000, or ARTH 4100.;;;ARTH3740;VISST3740;;;Art and everyday life in nineteenth and early-twentieth century America with emphasis on Anglo-European traditions. Considers democratic cultures and identities through topical units: the Peale family and America's first public museum; P.T. Barnum's "freak shows," traveling circus, and working-class audiences; daguerreotypes and the rising middle class; genre painting and regional types including the Yankee peddler, Missouri boatman, and the frontiersman; Hudson River School and the "tourist sublime;" artist-explorers, Darwin, and Latin American as spectacle; class and gender construction in the Gilded Age; the neurasthenic body and the turn of the century; Ashcan School, New York City, and urban spectators; immigrants, "slumming," and documentary photography. Alongside paintings, we examine political cartoons, fashion, advertisements, and popular illustrations.
AMST3742;;;Contemporary African American Poetry;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;ASRC3740;ENGL3740;;;This course will examine a variety of voices in contemporary African American poetry, focusing on works produced in the decades following the Civil Rights and Black Power Movements. We will consider how new generations of black poets are using verse to represent personal and collective history; to interrogate race and other social categories like gender and sexuality; and to ungate new perspectives for understanding the human condition. Along with verse, we will also study other forms of poetry like Hip Hop and spoken word that inform the contemporary African American lyric. Authors will include Rita Dove, Yusef Komunyakaa, Elisabeth Alexander, Natasha Trethewey, Terrance Hayes, and Lyrae Van Clief-Stefanon.
AMST3744;;;America Becomes Modern: The Gilded Age and Progressive Era;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;HIST3740;;;"America Becomes Modern" offers an upper-level survey of major themes in American history between 1877 and 1917. The course will have a lecture/discussion format; student participation is highly valued and encouraged. The last two decades of the 19th century and the first two of the twentieth marked an abrupt shift in the life experiences of the American people. Daily life changed radically from 1877-1920, as the agrarian republic gave way to an urbanizing consumer society. Debates about "progress" characterized the period, as new technologies, new peoples, new forms of politics and culture, and new patterns of living transformed the United States. This course will explore the political, economic, diplomatic and cultural history of the Gilded age and Progressive eras, focusing on the ways American tried to make sense of, to order, to moralize and to shape rapid change.
AMST3777;;;The United States;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ANTHR3777;LSP3777;;;The anthropological inquiry into one's own culture is never a neutral exercise.  This course will explore issues in the cultural construction of the United States as a "pluralistic" society.  We will look at the ideological context for the production of a cultural profile predicted upon ideas that are intrinsic to American images of identity such as individualism, freedom, and equality and the way these are applied in practice.  The course readings will include historic documents and accounts, popular writing, and recent ethnographies on the United States.
AMST3830;;;Latinos in U.S. History;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;HIST3800;LSP3800;;;How would our understanding of U.S. History change if we began the national narrative in 16th century New Mexico rather than 17th century Virginia? What does U.S. history look like when examined as hemispheric history? What if we were to bring the periphery to the center and examine U.S. History from the vantage point of the colonized and the immigrant, the exile and the transnational? This course seeks to reframe U.S. history by reconstituting what we understand as "American" history. We will examine territorial expansion and empire, migration and nation building, industrialization and labor, war and revolution, and citizenship and transnationalism in the "American experience" broadly defined to include americanos of Spanish, Mexican, Caribbean, and Central/South American ancestries.

AMST4021;;;American Conservative Thought;;;4;;;Fall, spring.;;;(KCM-AS);;;;;;GOVT4021;;;American conservative thought rests on assumptions that are strikingly different from those made by mainstream American liberals.  However, conservative thinkers are themselves committed to principles that are both quite varied and sometimes contradictory.  This course examines the assumptions upon which rest the libertarian, market/economic, and cultural/traditional strains of American conservatism and asks whether the tensions between them weaken or strengthen conservative thought as an alternative to mainstream liberalism.
AMST4039;;;Reconstruction and the New South;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;ASRC4390;ASRC6391;HIST4390;HIST6391;;;This course focuses on the American South in the nineteenth century as it made the transition from Reconstruction to new forms of social organization and patterns of race relations. Reconstruction will be considered from a sociopolitical perspective, concentrating on the experiences of the freed people. The New South emphasis will include topics on labor relations, economic and political changes, new cultural alliances, the rise of agrarianism, and legalization of Jim Crow.

AMST4112;;;The Politics of Change;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;GOVT4112;;;President Barack Obama was elected in 2008 amid hopes of his supporters that the United States would address numerous pressing domestic policy issues. In this course, we assess Obama's first term, examining why he accomplished his goals in some areas and not in others. We will also analyze the course that reforms took, and why alternative pathways were not pursued. Our inquiry will immerse us in the study of the institutional arrangements of American politics, the current political context, the challenges and opportunities posed by existing policies, and the legacy of past efforts to address key issues. In the first few weeks of the semester, students will learn about the relationship between the White House and Capitol Hill and the rise of partisan polarization in Congress. The body of the course will focus on prominent issue areas, such as: taxes and inequality, health care, higher education, K-12 education, and the environment. In each case, we will examine the issue in historical perspective by analyzing past reform efforts, and we will consider the Obama administration's record to date and consider the implications for success over the next few years. Students will have the opportunity to write in-depth research papers.
AMST4194;;;American Shakespeare;;;4;;;Fall, spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;ENGL4291;PMA4190;;;What is distinctive about American Shakespeare? Is it merely a less confident cousin of its more prestigious UK relative; or does it have a character of its own? What is currently happening with 'American Shakespeare' that is not happening anywhere else? This course is designed explicitly to exploit the wide variety of human and material resources of the DC and surrounding area, such as the Folger Shakespeare Library and Theatre, the Shakespeare Theatre and the Blackfriars Playhouse at Staunton. While encountering a number of plays, students will have the opportunity to see at least three live performances and numerous movies, consider the history of Shakespeare in America and learn from actors, directors, scholars and designers.
AMST4218;;;History of the United States Senate;;;4;;;Fall, spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;GOVT4218;HIST4030;;;This course will offer students an opportunity to view the process of shaping national debates from the perspective of the United States Senate. The modern Senate will serve as the point of reference for an inquiry into the development of the institution's powers under the Constitution during the past 200 years. Class readings, lectures and discussions will focus on the themes of continuity and change, the role of individual senators, and the institutional evolution of the Senate. In addition to general class reading and written examinations, each student will write a short paper and participate in an oral presentation.
AMST4300;;;The Milman Seminar;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;The Milman Seminar: Baseball in American Culture. Through a reading of fiction and nonfiction, we examine the role of baseball as it has shaped and reflected the attitudes and values of Americans. (Novels assigned in the course include Bernard Malamud, The Natural; Mark Harris, Bang the Drums Slowly; Philip Roth, The Great American Novel; and Robert Coover, The Universal Baseball Association. Non-fiction works may include Neil Lanctot, Negro League Baseball, Roger Kahn, The Boys of Summer, and Andrew Zimbalist, Baseball and Billions.  Each student in the course writes a 25- to 35-page research paper.)
AMST4301;;;The Rabinor Seminar;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;ENGL4620;LSP4620;;;The Rabinor Seminar explores the role of diversity in the formation of a distinct American tapestry. The specific topic varies each year, but the general subject is the promise and experience of pluralism. 
AMST4306;;;Art and Social Histories;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ARTH4761;VISST4761;;;Topic for spring 2015: Mass Culture in the Great Depression This seminar explores public art and popular entertainments as the means for everyday people to politically engage or escape the Great Depression (1929-41).  Discussions include Living Newspapers, the Federal Theater Project, WPA printmakers, FSA photographers (Walker Evans, Dorothea Lange, Gordon Parks, Arthur Rothstein), and Social Realist painters (Reginald Marsh, Ben Shahn). Connecting these is FDR's New Deal, its controversial government support for the arts, and censorship.  We consider dance as political theater, big bands and swing, "screwball" comedies, Busby Berkeley "gold diggers" musicals, and Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers spectaculars.  We begin with the importance of early radio in the home and how it constructed gender and race through soap operas and serial thrillers, especially the Green Hornet and the Shadow.  Students will draw on the digitized American Memory Project, Ken Burns' documentary The Dustbowl, and the Johnson Art Museum print and photography collections.  Films include Gold Diggers of 1933, Stella Dallas, Sullivan's Travels, and Woody Allen's Radio Days.
AMST4313;;;The Beautiful Struggle: Radical Aesthetics and Politics;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;ENGL4313;;;Now let us begin.  Now let us rededicate ourselves to the long and bitter, but beautiful, struggle for a new world. The course will begin from the declaration made by Martin Luther King, Jr. that the struggle for a new world, inevitably political, is also beautiful, that is, that it is involved with aesthetics. "The struggle is beautiful, I'm too strong for your slavery," raps Talib Kweli, thirty-seven years after King's speech.  What did King mean, and what have others in American culture meant, when they invoked beauty and struggle in the same breath?  What have the arts and radical politics had to do with each other?  When have radical politics and experimental aesthetics needed each other?  We will work with all forms of the arts; discussion will figure heavily in this effort; political and aesthetic theory will surface regularly.
AMST4393;;;The Underground Railroad and the Coming of the Civil War;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;ASRC4393;HIST4393;HIST6393;;;In 1850 American politicians banded together cross-regionally, passed a Fugitive Slave Law and breathed a sigh of relief, thinking they had once again dodged the slavery issue that threatened disunion. This "Bloodhound Bill" was designed to make "slave" catchers of all Northern whites. Instead it set in motion waves of protests, transformed previously silent whites into underground conductors, further emboldened veteran underground workers and forced thousands of self emancipated Northern blacks to emigrate. The Underground Railroad contributed to convincing Southerners that the Government would not or could not protect slavery. This course examines underground activism beginning in 1850 and offers an interpretation of how the Underground Railroad led to emancipation. The ebbs and flows of underground activity; transnational networks; Civil War military and geo-political issues; and what W.E.B. DuBois called the "General Strike" all contributed to making the Thirteenth Amendment a foregone conclusion.
AMST4402;;;Women in Hip Hop;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;AMST6402;ANTHR4102;ANTHR7102;ASRC4402;ASRC6402;FGSS4402;FGSS6402;LGBT4402;LGBT6402;;;This course will explore how women are portrayed in hip hop music and culture, addressing women both as consumers and producers. We will draw on texts that analyze misogyny in hip hop music and music videos, while also looking at how both mainstream and marginalized female hip hop artists contest sexually exploitative images of women. The course will utilize Black feminist theory, consumption theory, and youth culture theory to help students interpret and critique the ways in which women are represented in hip hop music, art, fashion, and dance, and in its surrounding culture. Considering analyses of African American, Caribbean, Asian-American, South African, and Latino interactions with hip hop, the course will investigate how youth construct gender and ethnic identities as they negotiate notions of African Diasporic belonging vis-a-vis hip hop. We will employ ethnographic, historical, sociological, literary, and interdisciplinary texts to explore questions such as: What do the sexual politics of rap music reveal about broader gender constructions? How can we compare the portrayal of women in hip hop to representations of women in related musical genres?  How are hetero-normative gender ideologies reinforced in hip hop culture? Does hip hop allow a space for alternative femininities? The course will also address broader questions related to representations of Black femininity, minorities in the media, gender and sexual identity construction.
AMST4404;;;The Black 70s: From Black Politics to Black Popular Culture;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;AMST6404;ASRC4404;ASRC6404;;;Using film, primary documents, literature, art, and secondary sources, this course explores the ten-year period between the assassination of Martin Luther King in 1968 and 1978, when The Supreme Court case, Regents of the University of California v. Bakke upheld the constitutionality of affirmative action, but imposed limitations on it to ensure that providing greater opportunities for minorities did not come at the expense of the rights of the majority. This decade marks one of the most turbulent periods in American history and radical changes impacting the political, religious, artistic, legal and educational cultures of Black people occurred during the period. For the most part we take these changes for granted without giving much thought to their origins. Through a variety of readings, discussions, and research papers, and through the screening of documentaries, the course aims to explore and arrive at a deeper understanding of the major events of the period and to understand how structural issues impacted the lives of African Americans, as well as how they responded to these upheavals. We will then seek to understand how that period relates to today.
AMST4585;;;American Political Thought;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;GOVT4585;;;This seminar will provide a survey of the history of American political thought, with emphasis placed on four significant periods: Puritan New England, the Revolution and Founding, Abolition and Civil War, and the Progressive Era.  Authors read may include: Winthrop, Hutchinson, Franklin, Paine, Jefferson, Madison, Warren, Tocqueville, Fitzhugh, Calhoun, Douglas, Garrison, Thoreau, Melville, Whitman, Lincoln, Adams, DuBois, Goldman, Dewey, Lippmann, Taylor, and Bourne.
AMST4587;;;Critical Race Theory;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;AMST6587;ASRC4587;ASRC6587;GOVT4578;GOVT6578;;;A political theory seminar that deals primarily with the conceptual and normative questions pertaining to racism and racial identity in the United States context.  Although the precise reading list will vary from year to year, the major figures and commentators may include W.E.B. Du Bois; Frederick Douglass; Booker T. Washington; Ida B. Wells; Charles Hamilton Houston; Thurgood Marshall; Hortense Spillers; Cornel West; Michael Dawson; Robin Kelley; Robert Gooding-Williams; Tommie Shelby; Cristina Beltran; Gary Okihiro; Gerald Torres; Rogers Smith; and Aziz Rana. The theme for 2015 will be African-American political thought and the "Long Civil Rights Movement." Ideally, students will have some background in African American studies and/or American political thought. Strong preference will be given to seniors and graduate students.
AMST4600;;;Melville;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;ENGL4600;;;An American whose life and writing ranged over the globe, Herman Melville (in the estimation of C.L.R. James) "saw the tendency of things." Our study of the fiction and poetry will turn on some of those "things" of modernity that most obsessively engaged Melville's representational and critical capacities: slavery; illegitimate authority; exterminationist policy directed against American Indians; capitalism; orphanhood and homelessness; imperialism; the attempted occultation of women; the shifting terrain of male comradeship; and the ambivalent resort to religion. We will be interested in testing the premise that Melville charted the fault lines of his world with an "unenrolled" critical acuity unparalleled in United States literature.
AMST4610;;;Studies in Modern Art;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;ARTH4600;;;Topic for spring 2015: U.S. Art of the 1960's
AMST4655;;;Topics in Social and Political Philosophy;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(KCM-AS);;;;;;AMST6656;GOVT4655;GOVT6656;PHIL4470;PHIL6430;SOC4430;SOC6430;;;Topic: Equality Efforts to reduce inequality are central to the pursuit of justice. We will investigate leading philosophical controversies about the moral basis of these efforts. To what extent, in what ways and why should the economic inequalities that arise in modern market societies be reduced? At what point does the use of government to reduce economic inequality unjustly conflict with liberty? How should the ideal of political equality be understood? For example, is it fundamentally important that citizens' political influence be approximately equal? What do the values underlying demands for political equality imply about relationships in the workplace? Do duties to reduce economic and political inequality among fellow-citizens properly extend worldwide?
AMST4661;;;Contested Continents: The Great War for Empire in North America and Beyond, 1754-1763;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;HIST4661;;;This senior research seminar offers students the opportunity to engage the vibrant history of the Great War for Empire (also known as the Seven Year's War, and the French and Indian War) from multiple perspectives.  In addition to the national and imperial categories traditionally employed in studies of the conflict, the course will also attend to its transnational character.  How did a war originating in a border dispute in what is now western Pennsylvania ultimately result in nearly one million battlefield deaths on four continents and in three oceans?  Should this be understood as the first "world war?" What was the impact of the war on the subsequent history of North America and the wider world?  Students will approach such questions from a variety of disciplinary approaches, including military history, the mobilization of economic resources, center-periphery political relations, and the involvement of indigenous nations - with an eye toward assessing the long-term consequences of the war and its enduring, complex, and contested legacy in popular memory (particularly the recently-completed 250th anniversary commemoration).  The course will emphasize critical interpretation of a rich array of primary documents and published scholarship, and each student will complete an independent research essay based on original sources.
AMST4701;;;Africa in the African American Mind;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;ASRC4701;HIST4701;;;This seminar examines some of the political and cultural visions of Africa and Africans held by African-American intellectuals and activists in the 19th and 20th centuries. Emphasis is placed on the philosophies of black nationalism, Pan Africanism and anticolonialism and the themes of emigration, expatriation, repatriation and exile. Awareness of Africa and attitudes toward the continent and its peoples have profoundly shaped African-American identity, culture and political consciousness. Notions of a linked fate between Africans and black Americans have long influenced black life and liberation struggles within the U.S. The motives, purposes and outlooks of African-American theorists who have claimed political, cultural, or spiritual connection to Africa and Africans have varied widely, though they have always powerfully reflected black experiences in America and in the West. The complexity and dynamism of those views belie simplistic assumptions about essential or "natural" relationships, and invite critical contemplation of the myriad roles that Africa has played in the African-American mind."
AMST4745;;;The Turning Point: American Literature and Culture in the 1940s;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;Prerequisite: At least one English class at the 3000-level or above.;;;ENGL4745;;;The War. The Bomb. Planetary Consciousness. Film Noir. In one of the most pivotal decades in history, the United States emerged as a superpower and its literature achieved a prestige unmatched before or since.  We will examine literary and other responses to the tumultuous events of the 1940s, from fascism's spread across Europe to the onset of the Cold War. Writers and artists, far from triumphalist, questioned the nature of humanity in the wake of incomprehensible catastrophe. A planetary consciousness emerged along with the modern ecological movement and the UN. Expect to read major authors like Richard Wright, Gertrude Stein, and Ernest Hemingway, novels of the war and a classic ecological treatise, alongside film and visual arts.
AMST4770;;;Transits of Empire: Early American and Native American Travel Writing;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;ENGL4770;;;This course examines early American travel literature by and about Native Americans in a comparative perspective. Beginning with Columbus's Diario, we will move sweepingly through to the 1830s, viewing along the way the writing of a broad group of travelers including Lewis and Clark, and Edgar Allan Poe. As a body of literature, their work observes and imagines "new" lands and places as a way of constructing and, occasionally, questioning colonial knowledge about Native others. Crucially, we will also be reading texts written by Native American authors (Samson Occom, William Apess, George Copway, and Black Hawk, among others), whose physical and narrative movements in and among Native networks here and abroad challenged colonial powers through their assertions of longstanding geopolitics, kinship systems, and cosmologies.
AMST4800;;;Race & Racism/Law & Society;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;AMST6800;ASRC4805;ASRC6805;GOVT4805;GOVT6805;;;A seminar that examines contemporary dilemmas in the construction of race and ethnicity in law, and the racialized construction of social problems and governmentality. We will examine classics in the field and new works, including those by Gerald Torres and Lani Guinier, Dorothy Roberts, Michelle Alexander, Jack Balkin, Derrick Bell, Osagie Obasojie, and the famous legal studies anthologies on critical race theory and law and society edited by Richard Delgado and Jean Stenfancic; and Kimberle Crenshaw, Neil Gotanda, Gary Peller, and Kendall Thomas. The issues that we will explore include: mass incarceration; the history and meaning of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; the social construction of race and ethnicity; the intractable character and historicity of white domination; and the history of black "cause lawyering."  Strong preference will be given to graduate students, law students, and undergraduates with previous coursework in the field.
AMST4805;;;Parody;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;FGSS4270;LGBT4270;PMA4805;;;In A Theory of Parody, Linda Hutcheon defines parody broadly as "repetition with critical difference, which marks difference rather than similarity." Taking a cue from Hutcheon, we will consider parody as a form of meaning making that is not necessarily used in the service of ridicule. Rather, we will examine a number of late-twentieth- and early-twenty-first-century imitative works in order to distinguish the rich variety of political agendas and aesthetic rationales for recent parody. An emphasis on postmodern or contemporary performances and media that renovate images, ideas, and icons from modernism and modernity will unite our otherwise diverse efforts. Some of these efforts will also highlight what happens when an artist takes up a work made for one platform (for example, theatre, performance art, installation, cinema, television, the Web) and parodies it in another. Creators and works under consideration may range from Christopher Durang, Split Britches, and Pig Iron Theatre Company to The Simpsons, Cookie's Fortune, and Strindberg and Helium.
AMST4851;;;Refugees;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;HIST4851;LSP4851;;;Since World War II, over 4 million people have migrated to the United States as refugees. In this seminar we will examine some of these refugee migrations and the ways these migrations challenged our understanding of the United States as a "haven for the oppressed." We will examine the crafting of refugee/asylum policy, the role of nongovernmental actors in influencing policy, and the ways policy reflected foreign-policy interests and security concerns. The last weeks of the course will pay particular attention to our changing definitions of who 'merits' asylum in the United States since the end of the Cold War.
AMST4990;;;U.S. Pop Music and Racial Common Sense;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;MUSIC4333;PMA4964;SHUM4993;;;This course brings together the fields of sound, popular music, and performance studies in order to investigate how "racial common sense" has been constituted at various moments in U.S. cultural history. Through the central trope of the "sensing body," this course draws from interdisciplinary analytics-listening, voice, audio-vision, accent, soundtrack, to name a few-in order to investigate the role of popular music and performance in how race has been naturalized. This course pays particular attention to the relationship between live performances and the various recording and media technologies that have impacted a longer U.S. cultural history: the phonograph, radio, microphones, film soundtracks, television, YouTube, critical and creative writing. Course assignments include: short reading and listening responses, album/performance reviews, an annotated bibliography/discography, group blog project, and final research paper.

Analyzes controversies and tensions (e.g., equity, market forces, state control) surrounding public education at local, state, and federal levels. Includes current and historical, urban, and rural issues and problems.
AMST6015;;;Photography and the Archive;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;ARTH6015;;;This graduate seminar explores the making of photographic archives, the narratives they tell, and the parameters that define them as objects of study. As visual collections, photographic archives present specific concerns - especially as digital technologies change the way knowledge is classified, stored, retrieved and disseminated. To be sure, differential power relations determine what is collected - what is remembered or forgotten - by societies and institutions. Social and economic histories as well as experiences of race, class, gender and sexuality affect the construction, acquisition and maintenance of archives and their ability to influence knowledge production. Students in this course study archival practices by choosing a unique photographic archive at Cornell for a research project, which may be realized as an exhibition (online or otherwise), a documentary film, or a digital humanities project.
AMST6201;;;The United States Congress;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;GOVT6201;;;The United States Congress will be examined: first, as a "closed system" in which institutional arrangements decisively apportion political power; and, second, as the product of electoral and social forces outside the institution. Emphasis will be placed on the historical relationship between institutional growth and state formation, parliamentary rules as both arrangements within which the "rational choices" of legislators are played out and as deliberate, constructions and allocations of political influence, and the use of legislative behavior as evidence in the analysis of fundamental principles of politics. Because the literature on the lower chamber is generally more rich, the House of Representatives will receive greater attention than the Senate.
AMST6210;;;Historical Archaeology;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;AMST3200;ANTHR3210;ANTHR6210;ARKEO3210;ARKEO6210;;;Historical archaeology attempts to bring textual and archaeological data to bear on questions of the past. In practice this can mean many different approaches, including some that are not traditionally termed "historical archaeology". This course explores the range of such efforts, asking questions like, What kinds of sites/contexts/data are amenable? What are the implications of the term "historical archaeology" itself? What has been and can be learned using these approaches?
AMST6308;;;Between Body and Mind: Anti-Universalism in Caribbean Postcolonial Thought;;;4;;;;;;;;;;;;ASRC6308;LATA6308;ROMS6308;;;
AMST6332;;;Seminar in Digital Humanities;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;HIST6332;;;This course will survey emerging digital humanities techniques, scholarship, and theory. We will cover the history of humanities computing, text-mining, "big data" questions, geographic information systems, collaborative projects and digital publishing, topic modeling, and other issues.  This workshop-style course will focus on acquiring new skills for research and analysis, building the scholarly literature, discussing theoretical implications, and applying theory and skills in individual and group research. Texts will be drawn from scholarship in history, literary criticism, and related fields.
AMST6402;;;Women in Hip Hop;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;AMST4402;ANTHR4102;ANTHR7102;ASRC4402;ASRC6402;FGSS4402;FGSS6402;LGBT4402;LGBT6402;;;This course will explore how women are portrayed in hip hop music and culture, addressing women both as consumers and producers. We will draw on texts that analyze misogyny in hip hop music and music videos, while also looking at how both mainstream and marginalized female hip hop artists contest sexually exploitative images of women. The course will utilize Black feminist theory, consumption theory, and youth culture theory to help students interpret and critique the ways in which women are represented in hip hop music, art, fashion, and dance, and in its surrounding culture. Considering analyses of African American, Caribbean, Asian-American, South African, and Latino interactions with hip hop, the course will investigate how youth construct gender and ethnic identities as they negotiate notions of African Diasporic belonging vis-a-vis hip hop. We will employ ethnographic, historical, sociological, literary, and interdisciplinary texts to explore questions such as: What do the sexual politics of rap music reveal about broader gender constructions? How can we compare the portrayal of women in hip hop to representations of women in related musical genres?  How are hetero-normative gender ideologies reinforced in hip hop culture? Does hip hop allow a space for alternative femininities? The course will also address broader questions related to representations of Black femininity, minorities in the media, gender and sexual identity construction.
AMST6404;;;The Black 70s: From Black Politics to Black Popular Culture;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;AMST4404;ASRC4404;ASRC6404;;;Using film, primary documents, literature, art, and secondary sources, this course explores the ten-year period between the assassination of Martin Luther King in 1968 and 1978, when The Supreme Court case, Regents of the University of California v. Bakke upheld the constitutionality of affirmative action, but imposed limitations on it to ensure that providing greater opportunities for minorities did not come at the expense of the rights of the majority. This decade marks one of the most turbulent periods in American history and radical changes impacting the political, religious, artistic, legal and educational cultures of Black people occurred during the period. For the most part we take these changes for granted without giving much thought to their origins. Through a variety of readings, discussions, and research papers, and through the screening of documentaries, the course aims to explore and arrive at a deeper understanding of the major events of the period and to understand how structural issues impacted the lives of African Americans, as well as how they responded to these upheavals. We will then seek to understand how that period relates to today.
AMST6424;;;Ethnoracial Identity in Anthropology, Language, and Law;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;ANTHR6424;LAW7231;LSP6424;;;This course examines the role that both law and language, as mutually constitutive mediating systems, occupy in constructing ethnoracial identity in the United States. We approach the law from a critical anthropological perspective, as a signifying and significant sociocultural system rather than as an abstract collection of rules, norms, and procedures, to examine how legal processes and discourses contribute to processes of cultural production and reproduction that contribute to the creation and maintenance of differential power relations. Course material draws on anthropological, linguistic, and critical race theory as well as ethnographic and legal material to guide and document our analyses.
AMST6472;;;The Problem with Rights;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;COML6472;FGSS6472;GOVT6776;HIST6472;LGBT6472;;;In June 2013, in the space of a week, the Supreme Court ruled on affirmative action, the legacy of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, and the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). While the first two decisions were perceived as a step back in the fight against racial discrimination, the repeal of DOMA was welcomed by mainstream LGBT-rights organizations as a decisive move towards equality. One of the goals of this seminar is to think these rulings together instead of treating them as separate entities. How did the struggle for sexual rights and the promotion of color blindness come to coexist so easily within the law? In order to understand how liberalism has operated historically and theoretically as a crucial site of regulation for sexuality and race, we will read texts from a wide range of contexts and disciplines including political theory, anthropology, literature, philosophy, history, and law. Readings will include "classic" critics of liberalism such as Marx, Nietzsche, Althusser, and Foucault, and contemporary authors such as Wendy Brown, Elizabeth Povinelli, Lisa Duggan, David Eng, Janet Halley, Katherine Franke, and Jasbir Puar, among others.
AMST6587;;;Critical Race Theory;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;AMST4587;ASRC4587;ASRC6587;GOVT4578;GOVT6578;;;A political theory seminar that deals primarily with the conceptual and normative questions pertaining to racism and racial identity in the United States context.  Although the precise reading list will vary from year to year, the major figures and commentators may include W.E.B. Du Bois; Frederick Douglass; Booker T. Washington; Ida B. Wells; Charles Hamilton Houston; Thurgood Marshall; Hortense Spillers; Cornel West; Michael Dawson; Robin Kelley; Robert Gooding-Williams; Tommie Shelby; Cristina Beltran; Gary Okihiro; Gerald Torres; Rogers Smith; and Aziz Rana. The theme for 2015 will be African-American political thought and the "Long Civil Rights Movement." Ideally, students will have some background in African American studies and/or American political thought.
AMST6606;;;The Politics of Pragmatism;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;GOVT6606;;;This seminar will explore the intersection of political theory and American pragmatism. While questions of political theory have often been seen as external to the concerns of pragmatism as a philosophy, this course will consider what practical tools pragmatism makes available for the study of politics. Central to pragmatism's originality is its radical and social conception of experience, which will be our primary focus this semester. Beginning with a study of Emerson, we will explore classical and contemporary statements of pragmatism and their political consequences. Among other topics we will discuss action, inquiry, belief, faith, and power. We will also consider the attempts of other twentieth-century thinkers to rethink the nature of experience and its relationship to politics, including Bergson, Du Bois, and Whitehead.
AMST6612;;;Colonial American Literature;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;ENGL6612;;;The American Revolution was a war fought by European settlers against England that ended the colonial domination of these settlers in the founding of the United States. But the settlers were themselves colonizers of American Indian land and nations and African labor: founders of a legalized colonialism that while it ended formally for African Americans with the Thirteenth Amendment continues today under the force of federal Indian law for the Native peoples of what became the United States. Reading Native American, African American, and Euramerican texts within a time frame that extends from 1492 to the end of the 18th century, the course will study the conflicts of colonial settlement that generated the United States past and present.

ANTHR1200;;;Ancient Peoples and Places;;;3;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;ARKEO1200;;;A broad introduction to archaeology-the study of material remains to answer questions about the human past. Case studies highlight the variability of ancient societies and illustrate the varied methods and interpretive frameworks archaeologists use to reconstruct them. This course can serve as a platform for both archaeology and anthropology undergraduate majors.
ANTHR1400;;;The Comparison of Cultures;;;3;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;;;;An introduction to cultural anthropology through ethnographies, or the descriptive accounts of anthropologists. Through readings and lectures, students acquaint themselves with a number of cultures from several parts of the world. The cultures range in form from those of small-scale tribal societies to those of state societies. Throughout the course, we attempt to make sense of exotic cultures in their own terms. Attention is focused on variation in cultural patterns as they are expressed in social, economic, and ritual practices. In this encounter, the principles of anthropology, as a comparative enterprise that poses distinct cultural systems in relief, will be developed. Fiction, films, and exercises supplement the formal anthropological materials.
ANTHR1401;;;The Scope of Anthropology;;;1;;;Fall.;;;;;;Prerequisite or corequisite: ANTHR 1300 or ANTHR 1400.;;;;;;This course is intended for majors in anthropology, prospective majors. Each week a different member of the faculty in anthropology at Cornell will make a presentation on the nature of their work within the field and discuss their interests with students. The course is meant to introduce the range of approaches found within anthropology and help students in planning future course work.
ANTHR1520;;;Tamil Conversation in Context;;;2;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANTHR2015;;;Archaeology of Empires;;;3;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;ARKEO2015;NES2615;;;The word "empire" today evokes modern, capitalist, European, even American experiments in expansion and domination. But empires have been part of the political repertoire for millennia, which means some very old technologies of power, violence, colonialism, as well as multiculturalism and tolerance have endured, in more or less direct ways, into our contemporary world. In this course, we comparatively examine a wide range of early empires-Roman and Persian, Aztec and Inka, Assyrian and Spanish-with an eye to understanding archaeology's unique contribution to the study of imperialisms past and present. That contribution, we shall discover, centers on the relationship between imperial power and the vast material world of things.
ANTHR2135;;;Beyond Kings, Palaces and Temples: Introduction to the Archaeology of South Asia;;;3;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ARKEO2135;ASIAN2265;;;This course will explore major themes in the archaeology of the South Asian subcontinent from the earliest palaeolithic hunter gatherers to the development of large empires in the mid first millennium CE. South Asia is an extremely diverse geographic and cultural region and we will deal with considerable regional variation: from large states and empires in some areas to foraging groups in others. The course will therefore be organized thematically, alternating between studying broad subcontinent-wide developments and examining illustrative regional case-studies. Some of the themes explored are: the beginnings of agriculture; the growth of complex political systems; and the role of inter-regional interaction. Students will be encouraged to situate the South Asian material within wider theoretical and methodological issues within archaeology and anthropology.
ANTHR2310;;;The Natural History of Chimpanzees and the Origins of Politics;;;3;;;Fall.;;;(PBS Supplementary List);;;;;;;;;This course will examine the natural history of wild chimpanzees with an eye toward better understanding the changes that would have been necessary in human evolutionary history to promote the emergence of human culture and political life. After an overview of early research and preliminary attempts to apply our knowledge of chimpanzee life to social and political theory, the class will focus on our now extensive knowledge of chimpanzees derived from many ongoing, long-term field studies. Topics of particular interest include socialization, alliance formation and cooperation, aggression within and between the sexes, reconciliation, the maintenance of traditions, tool use, nutritional ecology and social organization, territorial behavior, and the importance of kin networks. The question of whether apes should have rights will also be explored.
ANTHR2400;;;Cultural Diversity and Contemporary Issues;;;3;;;Spring.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;;;;This course will introduce students to the meaning and significance of forms of cultural diversity for the understanding of contemporary issues. Drawing from films, videos, and selected readings, students will be confronted with different representational forms that portray cultures in various parts of the world, and they will be asked to examine critically their own prejudices as they influence the perception and evaluation of cultural differences. We shall approach cultures holistically, assuming the inseparability of economies, kinship, religion, and politics, as well as interconnections and dependencies between world areas (e.g., Africa, Latin America, the West). Among the issues considered: "political correctness" and truth; nativism and ecological diversity; race, ethnicity, and sexuality; sin, religion, and war; global process and cultural integrity.
ANTHR2410;;;South Asian Diaspora;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;AAS2100;;;This interdisciplinary course (with an emphasis in anthropology) will introduce students to the multiple routes/roots, lived experiences, and imagined worlds of South Asians who have traveled to various lands at different historical moments spanning Fiji, South Africa, Mauritius, Britain, Malaysia, United States, Trinidad, and even within South Asia itself such as the Tamil-speaking population of Sri Lanka. The course will begin with the labor migrations of the 1830s and continue up to the present period. The primary exercise will be to compare and contrast the varied expressions of the South Asian Diaspora globally in order to critically evaluate this transnational identity. Thus, we will ask what, if any, are the ties that bind a fifth-generation Indo-Trinidadian whose ancestor came to the New World as an indentured laborer or "coolie" in the mid-19th century to labor in the cane fields, to a Pakistani medical doctor who migrated to the United States in the late 1980s. If Diaspora violates a sense of identity based on territorial integrity, then could "culture" serve as the basis for a shared identity?
ANTHR2421;;;Sex and Gender in Cross-Cultural Perspective;;;3;;;Fall.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;FGSS2421;;;An introduction to the anthropology of sex, sexuality and gender, this course uses case studies from around the world to explore how the worlds of the sexes become gendered.  In ethnographic, ethnohistorical and contemporary globalizing contexts, we will look at: intersexuality &amp; 'supernumerary' genders; physical &amp; cultural reproduction; sexuality; and sex- &amp; gender-based violence &amp; power. We will use lectures, films, discussion sections and short field-based exercises.
ANTHR2455;;;Real World Anthropology;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;;;;This course is designed to expose students to the range of ways and fields within which practitioners employ anthropological theory, methods and perspectives. Class format will include both lectures and workshop sessions with invited speakers. Both the invited speakers and the discussion topics will represent different broadly defined fields in which anthropologists practice. Through class discussion and writing, students will be expected to critically consider such issues as: research ethics, professional responsibility, the academic versus activist role, methodological practices, and the relationship between individual practitioners and the national, international, and organization contexts within which they work. Students will produce a major research paper examining a particular field of "practical" anthropology of their interest.
ANTHR2468;;;Medicine, Culture, and Society;;;3;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;BSOC2468;STS2468;;;Medicine has become the language and practice through which we address a broad range of both individual and societal complaints. Interest in this "medicalization of life" may be one of the reasons that medical anthropology is currently the fastest-growing subfield in anthropology. This course encourages students to examine concepts of disease, suffering, health, and well-being in their immediate experience and beyond. In the process, students will gain a working knowledge of ecological, critical, phenomenological, and applied approaches used by medical anthropologists. We will investigate what is involved in becoming a doctor, the sociality of medicines, controversies over new medical technologies, and the politics of medical knowledge. The universality of biomedicine (or hospital medicine) will not be taken for granted, but rather we will examine the plurality generated by the various political, economic, social, and ethical demands under which biomedicine has developed in different places and at different times. In addition, biomedical healing and expertise will be viewed in relation to other kinds of healing and expertise. Our readings will address medicine in North America as well as other parts of the world. In class, our discussions will return regularly to consider the broad diversity of kinds of medicine throughout the world, as well as the specific historical and local contexts of biomedicine.
ANTHR2472;;;Engaging Other Cultures: Learning How to Learn About Cultural Differences;;;3;;;Fall.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;;;;Engaging Other Cultures develops understandings and skills required to live and work in diverse cultural and organizational contexts, abroad and at home. Learning to deal effectively with linguistic, organizational, and cultural differences opens us up to the creative range of human beings and helps us learn from others in secure, analytical, and self-reflective ways. The course introduces basic anthropological and linguistic perspectives on cultural and organizational differences, ethnographic fieldwork techniques, ethnographic writing through ethnographic practice, with some attention to the language learning process. It is a general education course with particular orientation to those studying abroad and/or working domestically or locally in organizational and cultural contexts new to them.
ANTHR2595;;;Japanese Culture and Society: Tradition and Modernity;;;3;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;;;;This is an introductory survey of Japan from an anthropological perspective.  Through ethnographies, fictions, films, and mass media materials, it covers a wide range of topics, including the family, marriage, education, workplace, life course, old age, death, rituals, notion of self, conception of time, popular culture, and minority peoples.  The exploration of these topics revolves around three groups of broader questions: 1) What are the distinctive features of Japanese social institutions and cultural idioms?; 2) What has been the Japanese course of social and cultural change?; Is Japanese modernity similar to Western modernity?; 3) What new social formations are appearing in contemporary Japan?; What is happening to the traditional ways of life?   
ANTHR2750;;;Human Biology and Evolution;;;3;;;Fall.;;;(PBS Supplementary List);;;Prerequisite: College biology.;;;NS2750;;;Examines the theories and mechanisms of modern evolutionary biology as they apply to present-day humans and their hominid ancestors. Lectures and discussions of molecular and paleontological evidence of human evolution, the causes and consequences of contemporary human biological diversity, and biological and behavioral modes of human adaptation to past and present natural and cultural environments.
ANTHR3000;;;Introduction to Anthropological Theory;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;;;;This seminar course is designed to give anthropology majors an introduction to classical and contemporary social and anthropological theory and to help prepare them for upper-level seminars in anthropology. The seminar format emphasizes close reading and active discussion of key texts and theorists. The reading list will vary from year to year but will include consideration of influential texts and debates in 19th-, 20th-, and 21st-century anthropological theory especially as they have sought to offer conceptual and analytical tools for making sense of human social experience and cultural capacities.
ANTHR3020;;;Representing Brooklyn: Race, Place and Popular Culture;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;AMST3020;ASRC3020;;;Hip Hop Brooklyn. Hipster Brooklyn. Immigrant Brooklyn. Brownstone Brooklyn. While today Brooklyn is New York City's hippest borough and the site of swift gentrification, booming real estate, and the ever-escalating displacement of immigrant and Black communities, in the 1980s and 1990s it was a hotbed of hip hop music, making the borough synonymous with Black cultural production. New York's most populous borough is still the home of the nation's most concentrated Black population. This course borrows from hip hop's notion of "representing" to explore popular and cultural understandings of race and place in Brooklyn as depicted in print, music, and film. How is Brooklyn represented? What do these representations reveal about Black cultural production, inequality and transnational identity formation more broadly speaking? Spanning the period from 1945 to the present day, emphases will include the grassroots movements of the 1960s-1970s, the commodification of hip hop in the 1980s-1990s, and close readings of iconic Brooklyn films such as Spike Lee's "Do the Right Thing," to reflect on how Black popular culture engages with Brooklyn's many ethnic groups. While materials are interdisciplinary in approach, our investigation is informed by anthropological, historical, and literary texts covering topics including immigration, transnationalism, gentrification, and gendered and racialized inequality. Texts include Marshall's Brown Girl, Brownstones; Mose Brown's Raising Brooklyn: Nannies, Childcare, and Caribbeans in Creating Community; Bailey's Jay-Z: Essays on Hip Hop's Philosopher King; Osman's The Invention of Brownstone Brooklyn: Gentrification and the Search for Authenticity in Postwar New York; and LaBennett's She's Mad Real: Popular Culture and West Indian Girls in Brooklyn.
ANTHR3061;;;Computing Cultures;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;No technical knowledge of computer use presumed or required.;;;COMM3560;INFO3561;STS3561;VISST3560;;;Computers are powerful tools for working, playing, thinking, and living. Laptops, PDAs, webcams, cell phones, and iPods are not just devices, they also provide narratives, metaphors, and ways of seeing the world. This course critically examines how computing technology and society shape each other and how this plays out in our everyday lives. Identifies how computers, networks, and information technologies reproduce, reinforce, and rework existing cultural trends, norms, and values. Looks at the values embodied in the cultures of computing and considers alternative ways to imagine, build, and work with information technologies.
ANTHR3210;;;Historical Archaeology;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;AMST3200;AMST6210;ANTHR6210;ARKEO3210;ARKEO6210;;;Historical archaeology attempts to bring textual and archaeological data to bear on questions of the past. In practice this can mean many different approaches, including some that are not traditionally termed "historical archaeology". This course explores the range of such efforts, asking questions like, What kinds of sites/contexts/data are amenable? What are the implications of the term "historical archaeology" itself? What has been and can be learned using these approaches?
ANTHR3255;;;Ancient Mexico and Central America;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;ARKEO3255;LATA3550;;;A survey of the cultural history of ancient Mexico and Central America, emphasizing Aztec and Maya civilizations. The use of ethnographic and historical information to enrich archaeological interpretation is a general theme. Specific topics include the emergence of settled farming life, the rise of civilization and the state, and the development of mechanisms that linked the many societies in the region into a single sphere of interaction.
ANTHR3400;;;Being and Becoming Black;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;AMST3402;ASRC3400;LSP3400;;;This course is about being Black throughout the Atlantic world. What constitutes Blackness? What experiences, cultural understandings and social problems shape the identities of people of African descent? In order to address these questions, the course focuses on the people who were relocated by the Atlantic slave trade to the Caribbean, South and Central America, and the United States, and on their subsequent migrations. We will explore the disparate cultural, national, historical and intellectual contexts in which Black identities are constructed, revealing both commonalities and differences. Paying specific attention to how racial identity is shaped by social context, the course will interrogate theories of Black identity formation and notions of Black nationhood, and will examine different perspectives on Diaspora theory. While readings are interdisciplinary in approach, our understandings of Blacks in the Atlantic world will be informed by ethnographic, historical and literary texts covering many cultural contexts including the U.S., England, Kenya, South Africa, Haiti, Puerto Rico, Brazil, Jamaica and the Dominican Republic. Students are urged to choose research topics early in the term from a variety of subjects including music, fashion, religion, literature, politics, sports, etc.
ANTHR3405;;;Multicultural Issues in Education;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;AMST3405;EDUC3405;LSP3405;;;This course explores research on race, ethnicity and language in American education. It examines historical and current patterns of school achievement for minoritized youths. It also examines the cultural and social premises undergirding educational practices in diverse communities and schools. Policies, programs and pedagogy, including multicultural and bilingual education, are explored.
ANTHR3420;;;Myth, Ritual, and Symbol;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;RELST3420;;;Examines how systems of thought, symbolic forms, and ritual practice are formulated and expressed in primarily non-Western societies. Focuses on anthropological interpretations of space, time, cosmology, myth, classificatory systems (e.g., color, totems, food, dress, kinship), taboos, sacrifice, witchcraft, sorcery, and rites of passage (birth, initiation, marriage, death). Examines both the roles of specialists (e.g., spirit mediums, curers, priests, ascetics) and nonspecialists in producing these cultural forms.
ANTHR3422;;;Culture, Politics, and Environment in the Circumpolar North;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;AIS3422;AIS6422;ANTHR6422;;;This course examines the cultures and histories of the circumpolar North.  The primary emphasis is on the North American Arctic and Subarctic with some attention to northern Eurasia for comparative purposes.  The focus is on the indigenous peoples of the region and the socio-political and ecological dimensions of their evolving relationships with southern industrial societies.
ANTHR3462;;;Democratizing Research: Participation, Action, and Research;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;ANTHR6462;;;This course centers on a family of research approaches variously known as activist research, engaged research, community-based research, public scholarship, and action research. These are both alternatives to and critiques of the common forms of university-centered research that separate "expert" researchers from the subjects of research and claim that the quality of research can be determined only by trained academics. Participants in engaged research view research as a means of social learning. Most importantly, they are guided by democratic ideals and values, in pursuit of public purposes and interests. No course can cover the full range of approaches and so this course brings the different approaches to the attention of the students, shows what the strengths and weaknesses of each are, and exhibits the various strategies and methods that typify them. A subset of the students will be participating in an ongoing community service activity of their own creation. The internships/community projects will be supported and overseen by the course supervisor, a faculty board, and the director of the Cornell University Public Service Center.
ANTHR3479;;;Culture, Language, and Thought;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;;;;The relationship among culture, language, and thought has been a core concern in anthropology. Language and culture are commonly defined as processes that are public and shared yet they also operate within and upon subliminal experiential realms. In this course we shall examine how anthropologists have explored this relationship, which is engendered in the interaction between culture and language as parallel mediating devices for the constitution, interpretation, and expression of human experience.
ANTHR3516;;;Power, Society, and Culture in Southeast Asia;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ANTHR6516;;;Examining the symbolic within cultural and social processes in Southeast Asia, anthropologists have produced contextually rich accounts of cultural uniqueness. Interpretive ethnographies tend, however, to downplay the role of power and domination. Using the traditional strengths of symbolic anthropology, this course examines how ritual, art, religion, and "traditional" values in contemporary Southeast Asian societies have been shaped by colonialism, war, nationalism, colonialism and socialism, and play a role in structuring ethnic, class, and gender inequalities. In addition to providing a broad and comparative ethnographic survey of Southeast Asia, this course investigates how culturally-specific forms of power and domination are reflected in national politics, and in local and regional responses to the economic and cultural forces of globalization.
ANTHR3545;;;People and Cultures of the Himalayas;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ANTHR7545;;;A comprehensive exploration of the peoples and cultures of the Himalayas. Ethnographic materials draw on the lifeways of populations living in the Himalayan regions of Bhutan, India, Nepal, and Tibet. Some of the cultural issues to be examined through these sources include images of the Himalayas in the West, forms of social life, ethnic diversity, political and economic history, and religious complexity.
ANTHR3703;;;Asians in the Americas: A Comparative Perspective;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;AAS3030;AMST3703;;;The common perception of ethnicity is that it is a "natural" and an inevitable consequence of cultural difference. "Asians" overseas, in particular, have won repute as a people who cling tenaciously to their culture and refuse to assimilate into their host societies and cultures. But, who are the "Asians?" On what basis can we label "Asians" an ethnic group? Although there is a significant Asian presence in the Caribbean, the category "Asian" itself does not exist in the Caribbean. What does this say about the nature of categories that label and demarcate groups of people on the basis of alleged cultural and phenotypical characteristics? This course will examine the dynamics behind group identity, namely ethnicity, by comparing and contrasting the multicultural experience of Asian populations in the Caribbean and the United States. Ethnographic case studies will focus on the East Indian and Chinese experiences in the Caribbean and the Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Filipino, and Indian experiences in the United States.
ANTHR3777;;;The United States;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;AMST3777;LSP3777;;;The anthropological inquiry into one's own culture is never a neutral exercise.  This course will explore issues in the cultural construction of the United States as a "pluralistic" society.  We will look at the ideological context for the production of a cultural profile predicted upon ideas that are intrinsic to American images of identity such as individualism, freedom, and equality and the way these are applied in practice.  The course readings will include historic documents and accounts, popular writing, and recent ethnographies on the United States.

ANTHR4055;;;Beyond Totalitarianism: Politics and Everyday Life in (Post) Socialism;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ANTHR7055;GOVT4554;GOVT6554;;;This seminar explores cultural, social and political transformations in the (post)socialist world through the methods and analytics of socio-cultural anthropology. Students will learn about the contradictions and paradoxes of socialist ideology and practice, and the enclosures and possibilities produced by socialism's fall. By combining theoretical readings, memoirs, ethnographic texts and films about the socialist period, "Beyond Totalitarianism" will foreground the domain of everyday life as the place where the nation-state, collective memory and political subjectivity become reconfigured in powerful and imaginative ways. While purposefully unraveling Cold War epistemologies, the seminar posits postsocialism as a framework and a critical standpoint from which to interrogate the problem of political will, which has been central to liberal conceptualizations of individual freedom and political agency.

We will draw on texts that analyze misogyny in hip hop music and music videos, while also looking at how both mainstream and marginalized female hip hop artists contest sexually exploitative images of women. The course will utilize Black feminist theory, consumption theory, and youth culture theory to help students interpret and critique the ways in which women are represented in hip hop music, art, fashion, and dance, and in its surrounding culture. Considering analyses of African American, Caribbean, Asian-American, South African, and Latino interactions with hip hop, the course will investigate how youth construct gender and ethnic identities as they negotiate notions of African Diasporic belonging vis-a-vis hip hop. We will employ ethnographic, historical, sociological, literary, and interdisciplinary texts to explore questions such as: What do the sexual politics of rap music reveal about broader gender constructions? How can we compare the portrayal of women in hip hop to representations of women in related musical genres?  How are hetero-normative gender ideologies reinforced in hip hop culture? Does hip hop allow a space for alternative femininities? The course will also address broader questions related to representations of Black femininity, minorities in the media, gender and sexual identity construction.
ANTHR4120;;;Archaeology of Orientalism;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;ANTHR6120;ARKEO4120;ARKEO6120;CLASS4760;NES4620;NES6620;;;What is the relationship between archaeology and politics? What role has archaeology played in the making of "the East"? And how has material culture been implicated in the discourses that conjure the East into existence? This course probes the archaeology of Orientalism in two respects. Most immediately, it examines the attitudes that have shaped archaeologies of the Near East from the discipline's imperialist beginnings to the present, considering several key tropes of the field (from "civilization" to "oriental despotism" and beyond). In another sense, our concern is the materiality of Orientalism, or the work of things in enabling various dispositions toward the Near East. We also consider Orientalism's antipode, nationalism, examining some of the region's indigenous archaeological approaches and the politics of archaeology today.
ANTHR4176;;;Humanitarian Affects;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;FGSS4876;GOVT4745;SHUM4876;;;Liberal feminists and political theorists argue that sentiments such as compassion and empathy have the capacity to alert us to suffering, injustice, and oppression, and thus incite transformative political action. This interdisciplinary seminar explores the challenges to this theory by staging a conversation between postcolonial, feminist, and queer theories of affect, and anthropological critiques of humanitarian projects. Sentiments are mobilized to defend borders, wage wars, grant asylum to refugees, provide medical care and disaster relief, and inspire feminist activism. We will analyze how these gendered and racialized ethical projects and political regimes are co-constituted, and how they mediate access to resources and survival, as well as political agency, subjectivity, citizenship, and national belonging.
ANTHR4216;;;Maya History;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;ANTHR6256;ARKEO4216;ARKEO6256;LATA4215;LATA6256;;;This course is an exploration of Maya understandings of their own history as it is reflected in ancient texts. We will begin by looking at episodes in Colonial and recent history to illustrate some of the ways Maya thinking about history may differ from more familiar genres. We will then review basic aspects of precolumbian Maya writing, but we will focus mainly on analyzing texts from one or more Classic period Maya cities.
ANTHR4230;;;History of Archaeological Thought;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;ANTHR7230;ARKEO4230;ARKEO7230;;;This course examines the history of archaeological interpretation and representation. Through an immersion in various genres of thought and writing, we will chart the historical development of archaeology as it has been transformed from inception to today. The course is organized into two concurrent parts. The first provides an intensive overview of the dominant positions and problems in modern archaeological theory. In this section of the course, we will explore the major historical movements in archaeological interpretation since the formalization of the discipline in the 19th century through the contemporary constellation of thematic concerns. It is in these discussions that we will strive to bring forward the subtle logics that underlie archaeological analysis. The second section of the course centers on an exploration of archaeological representation and overlapping issues raised in the sister field of historiography. In this section of the course we will discuss general issues in the philosophy of history as they bear upon the production of landmark archaeological studies, engaging with a series of pivotal research projects. By the end of the course, students should have a thorough understanding of the theoretical frameworks that underlie contemporary archaeological research and the unique problems that follow efforts to interpret and represent the archaeological record.
ANTHR4256;;;Books of Fate, Books of the Ancestors: Astrology and History in Ancient Mesoamerica;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ARKEO4256;LATA4250;;;An introduction to belief systems in ancient Mexico and Central America, emphasizing the blending of religion, astrology, myth, history, and prophecy. Interpreting text and image in pre-Columbian books and inscriptions is a major focus.
ANTHR4390;;;Topics in Biological Anthropology;;;4;;;Fall, spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;Current topics in biological anthropology are explored. Topics change each semester.
ANTHR4402;;;Anthropology of Education;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ANTHR7402;EDUC4402;EDUC7402;;;This seminar examines public schools and other educational spaces as sites where knowledge, learning/learner, and identities are produced and contested. It explores how power and cultural norms work in educational settings, and the unintended teaching and learning that happens outside the purported curriculum. Topics include issues of multiculturalism and pluralism in schools and society, the school achievement of racial/ethnic minorities, youth cultures and identities, and literacy in adult learning spaces. This course is for students interested in the advanced study of multicultural schooling and education.
ANTHR4413;;;Walter Benjamin;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ANTHR7413;COML4429;COML6429;GERST4413;GERST6413;JWST4913;JWST7913;NES4913;NES7913;;;This extraordinary figure died in 1941, and his death is emblematic of the intellectual depradations of Nazism. Yet since World War II, his influence, his reputation, and his fascination for scholars in a wide range of cultural and political disciplines has steadily grown. He is seen as a bridging figure between German and Jewish studies, between materialist critique of culture and the submerged yet powerful voice of theology, between literary history and philosophy. We will review Benjamin's life and some of the key disputes over his heritage; read some of the best-known of his essays; and devote significant time to his enigmatic and enormously rich masterwork, the Arcades Project, concluding with consideration of the relevance of Benjamin's insights for cultural and political dilemmas today.
ANTHR4419;;;Anthropology of Corporations;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;ANTHR7419;;;This course develops an anthropological approach to corporations with a focus on large, profit-oriented, publicly-traded corporations. To denaturalize the corporation, we will consider competing cultural logics internal to corporations as well as the contingent historical processes and debates that shaped the corporate form over the past two centuries. The course will examine processes through which various social groups have sought to alter and restrain corporations as well as reciprocal corporate attempts to reshape the social environment in which they operate.
ANTHR4437;;;Development, Humanitarianism, and the Will to Improve;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ANTHR7437;;;This seminar develops an ethnographic approach to projects aiming to improve the human condition. Our object of study - development, humanitarianism, and the will to improve - is defined capaciously to allow for the study of projects ranging in orientation from politically conservative to progressive and revolutionary; from religious to secular; and from the global South to the global North. Whether we are studying construction megaprojects or hygiene lessons, programs for preserving tradition or introducing modernity, climate change mitigation efforts or truth commissions, we will explore ethnographically the actors, targets, explicit motives, practical techniques, and intended and unintended consequences. Our aim will be to link the micropolitics of lived experience and intersubjective relations to the macropolitics that structure and enable improvement projects.
ANTHR4520;;;Society and Culture in the Nilgiris: Engaged Research in Rural South India;;;4;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ANTHR4553;;;Anthropology Through Intensive China Ethnography;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ANTHR7553;;;This course develops an integrative approach to anthropological theory by means of an intensive examination of local life in China. Among the linked topics are family and kinship, local identity, ritual, cultural constructions of space and time, gender, ideology, and "modes of production of desire." Its primary objective is to illustrate the advantages of a broadly synthetic approach to socio-cultural anthropology by means of a close analytical examination of elements of local social life. In theoretical terms, the course advocates an accommodation among historical, psychoanalytic, and Marxian perspectives.
ANTHR4732;;;The New Latin American State;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ANTHR7732;LATA4732;LATA7732;;;Latin America today is the site of multiple utopian and practical experiments in governance. This seminar will problematize the simultaneous growth of neo-liberal, neo-socialist, and para-state formations. Using ethnography, documentary film, and theories of Latin American geopolitics, we will explore how dominant paradigms for political economy and fantasies of control emerge within contests over charisma, power, and legitimate violence. Why have indigenous and ethno-racialized social movements, or the return of the traditionally repressed, figured in projects of national or counter-national revitalization? What roles have self-defense organizations played in the re-definition of civil society? What does it mean to advocate for 'cultural diversity' or 'rights of nature'? Why have discourses of 'security' and 'human rights' come to be so charged in state bureaucracies and horizontalist political associations alike? This seminar will delve into a wide ranging array of texts that probe these and other questions about the new Latin American state.
ANTHR4810;;;East European Jewish Culture;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ANTHR7810;JWST4910;JWST7910;NES4910;NES7910;;;An autonomous, diasporic Jewish culture flourished in Eastern Europe from the early modern period through the mid-twentieth century and beyond. It is the ancestral culture of the vast majority of American Jews today, and thus a major source of American culture more generally. Its productions span the range of the religious and the secular, and trouble those very categories. Its reford constitutes a treasure trove of reflections on universality and particularity, self-determination and domination, the search for individual expression and the call of collective solidarity. This course will draw on a wide range of disciplines (especially anthropology, history, and literary studies) and a wide range of genres (fiction, historiography, autobiography, film) to recapture some sense of the living, dynamic cultural world of East European Jews.
ANTHR4900;;;Field Research Abroad;;;1-4;;;Fall, spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;Field research abroad as part of the Cornell-Nepal Studies Program, the Cornell-Honduras Program, or other departmentally approved programs. Topics are selected and project proposals prepared by student in consultation with faculty. Fieldwork typically involves extended research (usually 4-6 weeks) in a foreign setting with faculty supervision, culminating in a major paper or report.
ANTHR4910;;;Independent Study: Undergrad I;;;1-4;;;Fall, spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;Independent reading course in topics not covered in regularly scheduled courses. Students select a topic in consultation with the faculty member who has agreed to supervise the course work.

ANTHR4983;;;Honors Thesis Research;;;3;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;Research work supervised by the thesis advisor, concentrating on determination of the major issues to be addressed by the thesis, preparation of literature reviews, analysis of data, and the like. The thesis advisor will assign the grade for this course.
ANTHR4984;;;Honors Thesis Write-Up;;;2;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;Final write-up of the thesis under the direct supervision of the thesis advisor, who will assign the grade for this course.
ANTHR4991;;;Honors Workshop I;;;1;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;Course will consist of several mandatory meetings of all thesis writers with the honors chair. These sessions will inform students about the standard thesis production timetable, format and content expectations, and deadlines; expose students to standard reference sources; and introduce students to each other's projects. The chair of the Honors Committee will assign the grade for this course.
ANTHR4992;;;Honors Workshop II;;;2;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;Course will consist of weekly, seminar-style meetings of all thesis writers until mid-semester, under the direction of the honors chair. This second semester concentrates on preparation of a full draft of the thesis by mid-semester, with ample time left for revisions prior to submission. Group meetings will concentrate on collective reviewing of the work of other students, presentation of research, and the like.
ANTHR6000;;;Proseminar: Culture and Symbol;;;6;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;Focuses on an appreciation of symbolic, expressive, and representational forms and processes both as producers and products of social activities. Through the study of symbolic anthropology, structuralism, exchange, myth and ritual, religion, gender, personhood, linguistics, semiology, etc., the course investigates how identity and meaning are linked to the practical exigencies of social life. While emphasizing aspects of the discipline generally associated with cultural anthropology, the course endeavors to set the stage for a dialectical understanding of social, political, economic, and symbolic activities as interrelated phenomena. The works of de Saussure, Levi-Strauss, Dumont, Geertz, Victor Turner, Sahlins, among others, as well as contemporary theories are given careful attention.
ANTHR6010;;;Proseminar: Social Organization;;;6;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;Focuses on linkages between culture and social institutions, representations, and practices. The nature of these linkages is debated from strongly contesting points of view in social theory (structuralist, poststructuralist, utilitarian, hermeneutic, Marxist). Unlike debates in critical theory where the form of contestation has been mainly philosophical, in anthropology these issues have developed in ethnographic analyses. The course briefly surveys kinship theory and economic anthropology with a focus on implications for general issues in social theory. Discussion of attempts to develop dialectical syntheses around the motion of "practice" follows. The issues addressed in this section carry over into the next, colonialism and post-colonialism, in which poststructuralist readings of history are counterposed to Marxist ones. Finally, Lacanian and Marxist visions of ideology as they relate to anthropological theory and ethnographic analysis are examined with particular emphasis on the cultural and social production of persons.
ANTHR6120;;;Archaeology of Orientalism;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;ANTHR4120;ARKEO4120;ARKEO6120;CLASS4760;NES4620;NES6620;;;What is the relationship between archaeology and politics?

We also consider Orientalism's antipode, nationalism, examining some of the region's indigenous archaeological approaches and the politics of archaeology today.
ANTHR6130;;;Archaeology and Texts;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;ARKEO6130;;;This seminar invites students to critically engage with the role of texts and material culture in reconstructing the past. Central to our discussion is a concern with the often contentious interplay between the disciplines of archaeology and the study of textual records. Is a complete understanding of ancient texts contingent upon the contextual information provided by archaeology and vice versa? What do we do in cases when text and material culture present contradictory perspectives? Should one perspective be privileged over the other? In addition to examining various case studies and analytic approaches that have brought together the archive and the field, we will explore how documents and artifacts are not straightforward 'sources' of information but were formed within specific historical and ideological contexts.
ANTHR6210;;;Historical Archaeology;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;AMST3200;AMST6210;ANTHR3210;ARKEO3210;ARKEO6210;;;Historical archaeology attempts to bring textual and archaeological data to bear on questions of the past. In practice this can mean many different approaches, including some that are not traditionally termed "historical archaeology". This course explores the range of such efforts, asking questions like, What kinds of sites/contexts/data are amenable? What are the implications of the term "historical archaeology" itself? What has been and can be learned using these approaches?
ANTHR6256;;;Maya History;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;ANTHR4216;ARKEO4216;ARKEO6256;LATA4215;LATA6256;;;This course is an exploration of Maya understandings of their own history as it is reflected in ancient texts.

We will then review basic aspects of precolumbian Maya writing, but we will focus mainly on analyzing texts from one or more Classic period Maya cities.
ANTHR6422;;;Culture, Politics, and Environment in the Circumpolar North;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;AIS3422;AIS6422;ANTHR3422;;;This course examines the cultures and histories of the circumpolar North.  The primary emphasis is on the North American Arctic and Subarctic with some attention to northern Eurasia for comparative purposes.  The focus is on the indigenous peoples of the region and the socio-political and ecological dimensions of their evolving relationships with southern industrial societies.
ANTHR6424;;;Ethnoracial Identity in Anthropology, Language, and Law;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;AMST6424;LAW7231;LSP6424;;;This course examines the role that both law and language, as mutually constitutive mediating systems, occupy in constructing ethnoracial identity in the United States. We approach the law from a critical anthropological perspective, as a signifying and significant sociocultural system rather than as an abstract collection of rules, norms, and procedures, to examine how legal processes and discourses contribute to processes of cultural production and reproduction that contribute to the creation and maintenance of differential power relations. Course material draws on anthropological, linguistic, and critical race theory as well as ethnographic and legal material to guide and document our analyses.
ANTHR6440;;;Research Design;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;This seminar focuses on preparing a full-scale proposal for anthropological fieldwork for a dissertation. Topics include identifying appropriate funding sources; defining a researchable problem; selecting and justifying a particular fieldwork site; situating the ethnographic case within appropriate theoretical contexts; selecting and justifying appropriate research methodologies; developing a feasible timetable for field research; ethical considerations and human subjects protection procedures; and preparing appropriate budgets. This is a writing seminar, and students will complete a proposal suitable for submission to a major funding agency in the social sciences.
ANTHR6462;;;Democratizing Research: Participation, Action, and Research;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;ANTHR3462;;;This course centers on a family of research approaches variously known as activist research, engaged research, community-based research, public scholarship, and action research. These are both alternatives to and critiques of the common forms of university-centered research that separate "expert" researchers from the subjects of research and claim that the quality of research can be determined only by trained academics. Participants in engaged research view research as a means of social learning. Most importantly, they are guided by democratic ideals and values, in pursuit of public purposes and interests. No course can cover the full range of approaches and so this course brings the different approaches to the attention of the students, shows what the strengths and weaknesses of each are, and exhibits the various strategies and methods that typify them. A subset of the students will be participating in an ongoing community service activity of their own creation. The internships/community projects will be supported and overseen by the course supervisor, a faculty board, and the director of the Cornell University Public Service Center.
ANTHR6482;;;Perspectives on the Nation;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;This course will critically examine the key texts that have informed our understanding of the nation and nationalism.  Beginning with some of the founding texts such as Hahn Kohn's "The Idea of Nationalism: A Study in its Origins and Backgrounds" (1994), Plamenatz's "Two Types of Nationalism" (1976), and Renan's "What is a Nation" (1939), we will then move on to more contemporary writings by Gellner, Hobsbawm and Anderson and end with alternate analytical approaches that have been informed by the "national question" in the "Third World" such as Partha Chatterjee's "Nationalist Thought and the Colonial World."   A central theme will be how notions of culture, power, and history are implicated in constructions of "the Nation." We will also explore the possibilities of an ethnographic approach to the nation and ask if such an analytical/methodological move may help us better grapple with the perplexing emotive dimension of nationalisms. The intersection of gender and nation will also form a section of this course.
ANTHR6516;;;Power, Society, and Culture in Southeast Asia;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;ANTHR3516;;;Examining the symbolic within cultural and social processes in Southeast Asia, anthropologists have produced contextually rich accounts of cultural uniqueness. Interpretive ethnographies tend, however, to downplay the role of power and domination. Using the traditional strengths of symbolic anthropology, this course examines how ritual, art, religion, and "traditional" values in contemporary Southeast Asian societies have been shaped by colonialism, war, nationalism, colonialism and socialism, and play a role in structuring ethnic, class, and gender inequalities. In addition to providing a broad and comparative ethnographic survey of Southeast Asia, this course investigates how culturally-specific forms of power and domination are reflected in national politics, and in local and regional responses to the economic and cultural forces of globalization.
ANTHR7000;;;Development of Anthropological Thought;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;ANTHR4000;;;Examination of the history and development of anthropological theory and practice.

Students will learn about the contradictions and paradoxes of socialist ideology and practice, and the enclosures and possibilities produced by socialism's fall. By combining theoretical readings, memoirs, ethnographic texts and films about the socialist period, "Beyond Totalitarianism" will foreground the domain of everyday life as the place where the nation-state, collective memory and political subjectivity become reconfigured in powerful and imaginative ways. While purposefully unraveling Cold War epistemologies, the seminar posits postsocialism as a framework and a critical standpoint from which to interrogate the problem of political will, which has been central to liberal conceptualizations of individual freedom and political agency.

We will review Benjamin's life and some of the key disputes over his heritage; read some of the best-known of his essays; and devote significant time to his enigmatic and enormously rich masterwork, the Arcades Project, concluding with consideration of the relevance of Benjamin's insights for cultural and political dilemmas today.
ANTHR7419;;;Anthropology of Corporations;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;ANTHR4419;;;This course develops an anthropological approach to corporations with a focus on large, profit-oriented, publicly-traded corporations. To denaturalize the corporation, we will consider competing cultural logics internal to corporations as well as the contingent historical processes and debates that shaped the corporate form over the past two centuries. The course will examine processes through which various social groups have sought to alter and restrain corporations as well as reciprocal corporate attempts to reshape the social environment in which they operate.
ANTHR7437;;;Development, Humanitarianism, and the Will to Improve;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;ANTHR4437;;;This seminar develops an ethnographic approach to projects aiming to improve the human condition. Our object of study - development, humanitarianism, and the will to improve - is defined capaciously to allow for the study of projects ranging in orientation from politically conservative to progressive and revolutionary; from religious to secular; and from the global South to the global North. Whether we are studying construction megaprojects or hygiene lessons, programs for preserving tradition or introducing modernity, climate change mitigation efforts or truth commissions, we will explore ethnographically the actors, targets, explicit motives, practical techniques, and intended and unintended consequences. Our aim will be to link the micropolitics of lived experience and intersubjective relations to the macropolitics that structure and enable improvement projects.

Why have discourses of 'security' and 'human rights' come to be so charged in state bureaucracies and horizontalist political associations alike? This seminar will delve into a wide ranging array of texts that probe these and other questions about the new Latin American state.
ANTHR7810;;;East European Jewish Culture;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;ANTHR4810;JWST4910;JWST7910;NES4910;NES7910;;;An autonomous, diasporic Jewish culture flourished in Eastern Europe from the early modern period through the mid-twentieth century and beyond. It is the ancestral culture of the vast majority of American Jews today, and thus a major source of American culture more generally. Its productions span the range of the religious and the secular, and trouble those very categories. Its reford constitutes a treasure trove of reflections on universality and particularity, self-determination and domination, the search for individual expression and the call of collective solidarity. This course will draw on a wide range of disciplines (especially anthropology, history, and literary studies) and a wide range of genres (fiction, historiography, autobiography, film) to recapture some sense of the living, dynamic cultural world of East European Jews.

The entire city confronts the student with almost 30 centuries of urban and architectural history. This course intends to reconstruct the urban history of Rome from its origins through the Middle Ages (10th century bc-12th century ad). The purpose of this course will be to discover the layers of Rome, combining archaeology with literature, architecture, and urban history with art history. The goal is a thorough and direct knowledge of the Roman and Medieval urban landscape and the way this landscape has sometimes survived until today. Special attention will be given to Roman and Medieval building typology, both private and public, and the development of the urban infrastructure (street system, water supply, fortifications, etc.). Strong emphasis will be placed upon continuity, use/reuse, and transformation of buildings and spaces, etc. Every week one or two different "regions" will be explored that are typical for a particular moment of the urban history. Visits to sites outside Rome also will be used to address the issue of urban history in Italy in antiquity and the Middle Ages.

ARKEO2015;;;Archaeology of Empires;;;3;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;ANTHR2015;NES2615;;;The word "empire" today evokes modern, capitalist, European, even American experiments in expansion and domination. But empires have been part of the political repertoire for millennia, which means some very old technologies of power, violence, colonialism, as well as multiculturalism and tolerance have endured, in more or less direct ways, into our contemporary world. In this course, we comparatively examine a wide range of early empires-Roman and Persian, Aztec and Inka, Assyrian and Spanish-with an eye to understanding archaeology's unique contribution to the study of imperialisms past and present. That contribution, we shall discover, centers on the relationship between imperial power and the vast material world of things.

South Asia is an extremely diverse geographic and cultural region and we will deal with considerable regional variation: from large states and empires in some areas to foraging groups in others. The course will therefore be organized thematically, alternating between studying broad subcontinent-wide developments and examining illustrative regional case-studies. Some of the themes explored are: the beginnings of agriculture; the growth of complex political systems; and the role of inter-regional interaction. Students will be encouraged to situate the South Asian material within wider theoretical and methodological issues within archaeology and anthropology.

What role has archaeology played in the making of "the East"? And how has material culture been implicated in the discourses that conjure the East into existence? This course probes the archaeology of Orientalism in two respects. Most immediately, it examines the attitudes that have shaped archaeologies of the Near East from the discipline's imperialist beginnings to the present, considering several key tropes of the field (from "civilization" to "oriental despotism" and beyond). In another sense, our concern is the materiality of Orientalism, or the work of things in enabling various dispositions toward the Near East. We also consider Orientalism's antipode, nationalism, examining some of the region's indigenous archaeological approaches and the politics of archaeology today.

Through an immersion in various genres of thought and writing, we will chart the historical development of archaeology as it has been transformed from inception to today. The course is organized into two concurrent parts. The first provides an intensive overview of the dominant positions and problems in modern archaeological theory. In this section of the course, we will explore the major historical movements in archaeological interpretation since the formalization of the discipline in the 19th century through the contemporary constellation of thematic concerns. It is in these discussions that we will strive to bring forward the subtle logics that underlie archaeological analysis. The second section of the course centers on an exploration of archaeological representation and overlapping issues raised in the sister field of historiography. In this section of the course we will discuss general issues in the philosophy of history as they bear upon the production of landmark archaeological studies, engaging with a series of pivotal research projects. By the end of the course, students should have a thorough understanding of the theoretical frameworks that underlie contemporary archaeological research and the unique problems that follow efforts to interpret and represent the archaeological record.

Likewise, the mockery or destruction of these monuments is seen as a potent act of political resistance. These phenomena, together with the related concept of "propaganda," have exerted a strong influence on the interpretation of pre-modern ruler portraits. This course will encourage students to think critically about visual cultures of political rule and to develop an account of the distinctions between ancient, medieval, and modern modalities of ruler portraiture and its reception. Our primary case studies will be the late Roman and Soviet states, with ample comparative material drawn from other polities.

ARKEO4670;;;Wealth and Power: Political Economy in Ancient Near Eastern States;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;JWST4670;NES4670;;;Early states emerged when select groups gained control over wealth and power and institutionalized that control. How this was accomplished is a question of political economy that we can approach from archaeological, anthropological, and sociological perspectives. The course introduces students to the intellectual development of historical materialism in Smith, Marx, and Weber, among others, and traces their influence on later socioeconomic historians such as Polanyi and Finley. More recent approaches deriving from world-systems, gender studies, post-colonial studies, game theory, and network theory are then applied to case studies that include the emergence of a Mesopotamian state ca. 3400 BC, the Akkadian and Ur III empires, Old Babylonian and Old Assyrian trade, pharaonic Egypt, the international Late Bronze Age world, Aegean palatial civilization, and the Phoenicians. Students are welcome to present and write on other topics also. Monroe will provide context and clarification to assist with the specialist literature, but prior coursework in ancient studies will be advantageous in critically evaluating and writing about all the course readings.

ARKEO6130;;;Archaeology and Texts;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;ANTHR6130;;;This seminar invites students to critically engage with the role of texts and material culture in reconstructing the past. Central to our discussion is a concern with the often contentious interplay between the disciplines of archaeology and the study of textual records. Is a complete understanding of ancient texts contingent upon the contextual information provided by archaeology and vice versa? What do we do in cases when text and material culture present contradictory perspectives? Should one perspective be privileged over the other? In addition to examining various case studies and analytic approaches that have brought together the archive and the field, we will explore how documents and artifacts are not straightforward 'sources' of information but were formed within specific historical and ideological contexts.

ARKEO6233;;;Greek and Roman Art and Archaeology;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;ARKEO4233;ARTH4233;ARTH6233;CLASS4746;CLASS7746;;;Topic for fall 2014: Reproducing Greek and Roman Art Since its inception in classical antiquity the creation of art has been intricately linked to practices of copying and reproduction. This class will investigate the question from different angles, a historical, a theoretical and a practical one. The historical approach focuses on what has been called the invention of art history in connection with various techniques of replication, reproduction, imitation and appropriation. The theoretical approach will discuss notions of "original" and "copy", "authenticity" as well as the "simulacrum" within and beyond an ancient context. Finally, the practical component will entail the documentation for a database (photography, archival work, scholarly research, bibliography) and restoration of some of Cornell's plaster casts. This collection, assembled in the 19th century explicitly for an academic context and once among the largest of its kind in the United States, is today in very bad condition. The seminar is one step among many of a recently initiated research project to rescue and reappraise this precious resource.

ART3306;;;Print Media: The Artist's Book and the Object Multiple;;;4;;;Fall or spring.;;;;;;Prerequisite: ART 2301.;;;;;;This course examines the Artist's Book and the Object Multiple, which expand the definition of an edition by being 3-dimensional, tactile, and often collaborative or text-based. Students will have the option to produce hand-made objects of various forms (for example, Louise Bourgeois' sewn books), digitally-printed and bound artists' books (such as Amy Sillman's zines), or any combination of the two (or example, Kiki Smith's editioned porcelain sculptures) and have access to digital printers, CNC routers, and various other fabricating machines as well as traditional printing presses. The class will be divided into units focusing on traditional skills in bookmaking, with guest instruction from the Wells Book Arts Center; on mold-making and casting, with emphasis on 3-D fabricating capabilities; and finally on the natures of hand-made multiples versus their machine-made digital cousins.
ART3404;;;Sculpture: Installation;;;4;;;Fall, spring, or summer.;;;;;;Prerequisite: ART 2401, or architecture design studio, or permission of instructor.;;;;;;Site-specific installations will be mediated through a variety of materials and individual and collaborative research.

ART3502;;;Drawing: The Body;;;4;;;Fall or spring.;;;;;;Prerequisite: ART 2501 or permission of instructor.;;;;;;This course investigates the human body as a pictorial subject. Emphasis is placed on the development of descriptive methodologies reinforced by a study of human surface anatomy and historic/contemporary applications. Relevance to a wide range of visual disciplines including sculpture, photography, digital media in addition to painting and drawing will be explored.
ART3601;;;Photography: Identity and the Global Lens;;;4;;;Fall, spring, or summer.;;;;;;Prerequisite: ART 2601, or permission of instructor.;;;;;;This course investigates the visual representation of identity in contemporary culture while considering the impact of global perspectives on the understanding and interpretation of self through the lens of race, gender, geography. This studio based course considers visual practice in relation to critical theory using lecture, group critique, and film and video screenings. Image capture will be by medium format camera and film and occasional digital SLR 35 mm camera. Advanced black and white and color negative and print processes will be taught. Medium format cameras are provided on a daily loan basis.
ART3604;;;Photography: Alternative Photographic Processes - The Composite Image;;;4;;;Fall, spring, or summer.;;;;;;Prerequisite: ART 2601, or permission of instructor.;;;;;;This course explores the composite image generated through various lens-based practices and equipment such as still and video camera, scanner, internet, etc. It is an intensive experimental studio integrating digital strategies of negative production to create images produced with traditional light-sensitive materials. Alternative photographic methods are approached as a printmaking process. Students are encouraged to work outside the camera and beyond the negative edge. The history of photographic print materials from the photogenic drawing of Talbot to the contemporary gelatin silver print will be introduced. Images will be produced using cyanotype, Vandyke brown, gum bichromate, and palladium emulsions.
ART3606;;;Photography: The Constructed Image;;;4;;;Fall or spring.;;;;;;Prerequisite: ART 2201, 2301, 2401, 2501, 2601, and 2701, or permission of instructor.;;;;;;The Constructed Image is an art studio course that explores the practice of fabricating or constructing the subject of a photograph. The course examines the history of the constructed image within the photographic canon, including conventional studio-based and location photography, along with artistic approaches to image making involving intervention and manipulation of the subject. In direct opposition to the methods of the candid and documentary genres, the constructed image depends on artifice and invention to create or manipulate the subject. This genre makes use of a vast range of techniques including lighting, staging, styling, directing, crafting, scripting, and more. Students will work both collaboratively and independently to produce visual works demonstrating the concepts and techniques learned in class. Topics include: The history and theory of the constructed image; lighting equipment and techniques; large and medium format camera equipment and techniques; materials, equipment, and construction techniques.

This course concentrates on the experimental use of video as installation combining the use of video/sound, tangible materials, and physical space.
ART3708;;;Digital Media: Hybrid Media and Global Arts Practices;;;4;;;Fall or spring.;;;;;;Prerequisite: ART 2701 or permission of instructor.;;;;;;This studio investigates moving image and sound in contemporary global art. Converging practices in digital video, animation, performance, activism and theory are at the center of these new and blended forms. Global contemporary art has dislocated the moving image and sound from the theater to spaces of global biennials, international museums and galleries and in political arenas. All of these sources will be investigated and used as creative inspiration. Projects will be realized for a variety of exhibition possibilities including contemporary art spaces, public spaces and the internet. Students will conceptually and technically investigate hybrid media in relationship to global culture and technology. Students will use software including Final Cut Pro and others to create hybrid media forms.

ART3802;;;Art History: Baroque Rome;;;4;;;Fall or spring (fall semester only after spring 2015).;;;;;;;;;;;;This course analyzes the masterpieces of Roman Baroque art and architecture from the end of the 16th century to the beginning of the 18th century. While analyzing urbanism, architecture, sculpture, and painting by many of the major artists of the period (Caravaggio, Bernini, Borromini, Cortona), the course considers the artistic trends that characterize the patterns of patronage in Counter-Reformation and Baroque Rome. Special attention will be given not only to the literary sources that shaped art theory, practice, and criticism but also to important issues such as propaganda, the viewer's emotional engagement, and the artist's social status. The unity of the visual arts, rhetorical effects, artistic rivalry, scenic urbanism, the relation between art and poetry, the use of classical and "bizarre" vocabulary, the concept of pastoral, the representation of ecstasy, and the idealization of death will be some of the themes explored in this course. Each art work, building, or urban plan will be studied as a document to understand broader concepts related to politics, religion, music, science, theatre, and philosophy.
ART3803;;;Art History: Italian Cinema;;;4;;;Fall or spring (fall semester only after spring 2015).;;;;;;;;;;;;This course examines the cinematic representation of Italy with particular emphasis to the use of settings and space.

ARTH2000;;;Introduction to Visual Studies;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;AMST2000;COML2000;VISST2000;;;Provides a broad introduction of modes of vision and the historical impact of visual images, visual structures, and visual space on culture, communication, and politics. The question of "how we see" is discussed in terms of (1) procedures of sight (from optical machines to the psychology of vision and the philosophy of aesthetics); (2) spaces of vision (from landscapes to maps to cities); (3) objects of vision (from sacred sites to illuminated books to digital art); and (4) performances of vision (race, sexualities, ethnicities, cultures). Of importance to the course is the practical and conceptual relation of 20th-century visual technologies (photography, cinema, video, and computing) to their historical corollaries in the arts. The course draws on the visual traditions of both Western and non-Western societies and study texts that have defined the premises and analytic vocabularies of the visual. Through viewings, screenings, collaborative writing, and art projects, students develop the critical skills necessary to appreciate how the approaches that define visual studies complicate traditional models of defining and analyzing art objects. Guest lecturers occasionally address the class. Requirements: two objective midterm exams; occasional listserve postings; two five-page papers.
ARTH2019;;;Thinking Surrealisms;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;COML2200;VISST2190;;;Borrowing its title from a formulation of Marxist philosopher Ernst Bloch, and beginning from the "forays of demoralization" instigated by the Dadas, who bequeathed to surrealism the precious gift of unreconciliation to the given, this course ranges over several surrealist moments: the inception of surrealist precept and practice in Paris in the mid-1920s;  the explicitly anti-fascist political phase of the 1930s and 40s; the supplementation of Parisian surrealism by Caribbean, Mexican, African American, Quebecois, and Mauritian writers and artists; the reflections of and on surrealism by Bloch, Walter Benjamin, and Theodor W. Adorno; the relations of surrealism to the Situationist International.  Throughout, the course will ask what the proliferation of "thinking surrealisms" meant to the culture and politics of modernity.  All readings in English.

ARTH3505;;;Blaxploitation Film and Photography;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;AMST3515;ASRC3505;FGSS3505;PMA3505;VISST3505;;;Blaxploitation films of the 1970s are remembered for their gigantic Afros, enormous guns, slammin' soundtracks, sex, drugs, nudity, and violence. Never before or since have so many African American performers been featured in starring roles. Macho male images were projected alongside strong, yet sexually submissive female ones. But how did these images affect the roles that black men and women played on and off the screen and the portrayal of the black body in contemporary society? This interdisciplinary course explores the range of ideas and methods used by critical thinkers in addressing the body in art, film, photography and the media. We will consider how the display of the black body affects how we see and interpret the world by examining the construction of beauty, fashion, hairstyles and gendered images as well as sexuality, violence, race, and hip-hop culture.

Beginning with kinetic art and the cybernetically inspired work of the late sixties, we will explore early uses of computer technology, including early experiments in synthetic video in the 70s. An overview of pre-internet telematic experiments will lead to an investigation of net art. The ongoing development of behavioral art forms including interactive art and interactive installation will be a central theme. Critical evaluation of various attitudes concerning technology will be encouraged.
ARTH3670;;;Visualizing el Barrio: Interpreting and Documenting East Harlem's Mural Tradition;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;AMST3672;ENGL3672;LSP3672;VISST3670;;;Visualizing El Barrio immerses students in a semester-long contemplation and class project that integrates artistic praxis with art history and literary studies to document the historical murals of East Harlem, otherwise known as Spanish Harlem or "El Barrio."  These murals tell stories about people, places, and events that resonate with El Barrio's predominantly Latino/a community and American culture more broadly.  The murals in East Harlem emerge out of a rich Latin American artistic tradition that migrated with the people who comprise the U.S. Latino/a diaspora. Through student research and documentation, "Visualizing El Barrio" will also participate in the preservation of East Harlem's historical murals, culminating in a celebration of the artwork with a student-curated exhibit of photographs and presentations.

We begin with an inquiry into the meaning  of national boundaries and the controversy of the Han Chinese people, which  helps us identify the scope of Chinese culture. Pre-dynastic (or prehistoric)  Chinese culture is presented through both legends about the origins of the  Chinese, and scientifically excavated artifacts. Art of the dynastic and modern  periods is presented in light of contemporaneous social, political,  geographical, philosophical and religious contexts. Students work directly with  objects in the Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art.
ARTH4100;;;Proseminar;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;VISST4200;;;Works of art have always engendered political, social, and cultural meanings. This seminar presents an introduction to the methods used by art historians and the objects and ideas that constitute the historiography of their discipline. If art history was once understood as the study of the development of style in "European art," over the past century its practitioners have attempted to embrace a "global" perspective and to address issues of class, ethnicity, nationality, sexual orientation, and gender. Readings will focus on historically situating methods and the implications of their cross-cultural application. Papers will encourage students to put methods into practice, realizing in the process that subject matter is not an isolated choice to which methods are applied, but something that profoundly affects the approach that the researcher brings to the writing of art history.

ARTH4161;;;Visual Cultures of the Andes;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ARTH6161;LATA4161;LATA6161;VISST4161;;;This seminar focuses on visual and performative cultures of the Andes from the Inca empire (ca. 1438-1534) to the present day. It traces the modalities of culture, power, and representation in the framing of Andean pasts and presents by tracing the social lives of images in Andean South America, which encompasses parts of Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, and Argentina. We will analyze a range of visual material, including textiles, paintings, photographs, and even tourist brochures to understand the dynamics of image-making and image consumption in the Andes. Given the seminar's broad temporal scope, we will embark on a series of case studies that serve to contextualize each historical moment of artistic production, from the Inca and colonial periods to the postcolonial period spanning the 19th century to the present. The final section of the course focuses on the politics of marketing "Andeanness" to contemporary audiences through museum displays, folkloric performances, and tourism. Readings will be drawn from an array of disciplines, including art history/visual culture studies, and anthropology.

Likewise, the mockery or destruction of these monuments is seen as a potent act of political resistance. These phenomena, together with the related concept of "propaganda," have exerted a strong influence on the interpretation of pre-modern ruler portraits. This course will encourage students to think critically about visual cultures of political rule and to develop an account of the distinctions between ancient, medieval, and modern modalities of ruler portraiture and its reception. Our primary case studies will be the late Roman and Soviet states, with ample comparative material drawn from other polities.
ARTH4445;;;Nature, Cultural Landscape, and Gardens in Early Modern Italy and France;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ARTH6445;VISST4445;VISST6445;;;This seminar will examine cultural understandings of nature in early modern Europe, especially Italy, including the notions of "second nature," "cultural landscape," and "pastoral." While agricultural activity transformed the natural landscape in the fifteenth century, so too did ever more extensive gardens. We will study the lavish gardens of cardinals, popes, and dukes that emerged in sixteenth-century Italy, with their terracing, fountains and statues that conceptualized the natural world and depended on developments in mechanics and hydraulics. Many new plant species began entering Europe from the Middle East and the New World in the sixteenth century, followed by the beginnings of botanical gardens in Europe. We will discuss these and the cultural significance of plants, animals, and collections of natural objects. We will also see the role of gardens and alteration to the land in the formation of national identity. The focus of the seminar is on Italian gardens of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries as well as some French gardens, culminating in the Versailles of King Louis XIV.
ARTH4507;;;Topics in Contemporary Art;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;ARTH6507;VISST4507;;;Topic for spring 2015: The Art Super Star and the Global Art Economy
ARTH4600;;;Studies in Modern Art;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;AMST4610;;;Topic for spring 2015: U.S. Art of the 1960's
ARTH4605;;;Art/Science Intersections: More than Meets the Eye;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ARTH6605;VISST4605;;;This interdisciplinary seminar capitalizes on the extraordinary loan of seventeenth-century Dutch paintings from a private collection to the Johnson Museum, and an ongoing Mellon Foundation initiative to study them and other objects from the Museum's collection, using both art-historical and scientific, data-driven modes of investigation. Both methods are invested in material culture: the communicative visible surface of the artwork and its underlying materials-support, ground, pigment. Within the context of early modern painting and works on paper, and drawing on Cornell's exceptional resources and key experts, we will employ various technical methods, including thread counting of historic canvases, pattern matching in historic papers, and microscopic pigment analysis, and will look for hidden images in paintings through x-ray fluorescence mapping at Cornell's synchrotron facility (CHESS).
ARTH4610;;;Women Artists;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;FGSS4040;;;This seminar examines both feminist art criticism and the work of women artists from antiquity to the present. We consider the works of the most prominent women artists from each period in relation to the changing roles of women in society. The artists covered include Jennifer Barlett, Artemisa Gentileschi, Elizabeth Vigee-Lebrun, Mary Cassatt, Kathe Kollwitz, Georgia O'Keefe, Louise Nevelson, Joan Mitchell, Judy Chicago, and Barbara Kruger.
ARTH4761;;;Art and Social Histories;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;AMST4306;VISST4761;;;Topic for spring 2015: Mass Culture in the Great Depression This seminar explores public art and popular entertainments as the means for everyday people to politically engage or escape the Great Depression (1929-41).  Discussions include Living Newspapers, the Federal Theater Project, WPA printmakers, FSA photographers (Walker Evans, Dorothea Lange, Gordon Parks, Arthur Rothstein), and Social Realist painters (Reginald Marsh, Ben Shahn). Connecting these is FDR's New Deal, its controversial government support for the arts, and censorship.  We consider dance as political theater, big bands and swing, "screwball" comedies, Busby Berkeley "gold diggers" musicals, and Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers spectaculars.  We begin with the importance of early radio in the home and how it constructed gender and race through soap operas and serial thrillers, especially the Green Hornet and the Shadow.  Students will draw on the digitized American Memory Project, Ken Burns' documentary The Dustbowl, and the Johnson Art Museum print and photography collections.  Films include Gold Diggers of 1933, Stella Dallas, Sullivan's Travels, and Woody Allen's Radio Days.
ARTH4840;;;Contemporary Taiwanese Art;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;ARTH6840;ASIAN4484;ASIAN6684;VISST4840;;;Contemporary Taiwanese Art is defined in this course as the art of Taiwan since the 1980s. The 1980s was a crucial transformative period in Taiwan's history when the island underwent major social and political changes. Art as part of this transformation was fully engaged in reshaping the images of Taiwan, revealing moment-to-moment social reconstruction. With internationalization policies and the effects of globalization, the island has undergone further rapid and dramatic transformations since the 2000s. These changes are also revealed in works by younger generations of artists. In this research seminar, participants will select research topics at the beginning of the semester as their final research paper projects, and through weekly meetings, we will refine and delve into each selected topic deeply.
ARTH4856;;;Producing Cloth Cultures;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ARTH6856;VISST4857;;;It is a fundamental part of human activity to dress or cover one's body and environment. While the symbolic significance of such clothing has long been recognized, the activity of producing fabric itself deserves more attention. By this we do not only mean the various techniques and technological devices involved in spinning, weaving, stitching, or sewing, but also the analogical activities and metaphors they entailed. What stories did they tell? How did their connection to writing, remembering, lovemaking, or ruling one's kingdom, to name but a few examples, play out metaphorically in cloth? And how did fabrics depend on or transform the transmission of techniques, fashions and motives, but also gender, concepts of the body or the built environment?
ARTH4860;;;Working Hot: Exploring Art Beyond Representation;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ARTH6860;VISST4860;;;The sizzling hiss of white-hot iron plunged in water, the slap and punch required to put a hole  in a solid wad of clay on a kick-wheel, the whirring of a drop spindle in motion. Can we capture or theorize the creative process? What happens in the heat of the moment when artists engage with their materials? This seminar, part of the Johnson Museum of Art's Mellon Foundation initiative, will explore the terrains of art beyond representation. Engaging art production with museum practice, the course will be taught by associate professor, Kaja M. McGowan, and associate director &amp; Ames Curator of Education, Cathy Rosa Klimaszewski. Classes will be held at the museum, and in a number of designated workshops where artists engage in the heat of the moment.
ARTH4956;;;Pygmalion: Aesthetics of Touch;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;CLASS4602;SHUM4997;VISST4956;;;"Please Do Not Touch" is one of the signs we are most accustomed to seeing in art museums, yet the very need to make this request demonstrates how objects often invite, seek, even demand that we transgress the limits of vision and engage with them physically. In the Pygmalion myth, the artist's creating hand and the viewer's desire to touch come together in a fantasy of union with the object that has been endlessly appropriated and reimagined in later Western culture. Focusing on Classical art, this course explores the role of touch and embodiment in the viewing and reception of art objects, drawing on ancient models of sense-perception as well as 20th Century theorists such as Reigl, Berenson and Merleau-Ponty.

ARTH6000;;;Graduate Research Methods in Art History;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;This seminar introduces graduate students to a range of methodologies and approaches to teaching and researching topics in art history and visual studies. Each week, a member of the faculty will present his or her work to the seminar, highlighting unique research approaches, areas of specialty, technological challenges, and professional and pedagogical rewards. Topics include defining a research question; conducting archival research and fieldwork; syllabus design; identifying funding sources; and grant proposal writing. This course is required for all art history Ph.D. students and open to graduate students from other departments. Students are encouraged to use current technologies for presenting their coursework, including the creation of a blog for documenting ongoing research questions related to their teaching and dissertation.
ARTH6015;;;Photography and the Archive;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;AMST6015;;;This graduate seminar explores the making of photographic archives, the narratives they tell, and the parameters that define them as objects of study. As visual collections, photographic archives present specific concerns - especially as digital technologies change the way knowledge is classified, stored, retrieved and disseminated. To be sure, differential power relations determine what is collected - what is remembered or forgotten - by societies and institutions. Social and economic histories as well as experiences of race, class, gender and sexuality affect the construction, acquisition and maintenance of archives and their ability to influence knowledge production. Students in this course study archival practices by choosing a unique photographic archive at Cornell for a research project, which may be realized as an exhibition (online or otherwise), a documentary film, or a digital humanities project.
ARTH6154;;;Feminism, Post-Feminism, and Cyberfeminism;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;ARTH4154;FGSS4740;FGSS6740;VISST4154;;;In this seminar students will investigate the emergence of feminism in art and theory and subsequent reactions of relevant artists and theorists to that movement. These developments will be discussed in relation to the accelerated technological developments of the twentieth century, which affected not only modes of communication and artistic production but also scientific and popular understandings of bodies, and nature. Themes will include sex and gender, nature, representation, pleasure, technology and the body, race, surveillance, pornography and agency. Media covered in the course include painting, performance, installation, video, film, and interactive digital media.

ARTH6161;;;Visual Cultures of the Andes;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;ARTH4161;LATA4161;LATA6161;VISST4161;;;This seminar focuses on visual and performative cultures of the Andes from the Inca empire (ca. 1438-1534) to the present day. It traces the modalities of culture, power, and representation in the framing of Andean pasts and presents by tracing the social lives of images in Andean South America, which encompasses parts of Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, and Argentina. We will analyze a range of visual material, including textiles, paintings, photographs, and even tourist brochures to understand the dynamics of image-making and image consumption in the Andes. Given the seminar's broad temporal scope, we will embark on a series of case studies that serve to contextualize each historical moment of artistic production, from the Inca and colonial periods to the postcolonial period spanning the 19th century to the present. The final section of the course focuses on the politics of marketing "Andeanness" to contemporary audiences through museum displays, folkloric performances, and tourism. Readings will be drawn from an array of disciplines, including art history/visual culture studies, and anthropology.
ARTH6233;;;Greek and Roman Art and Archaeology;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;ARKEO4233;ARKEO6233;ARTH4233;CLASS4746;CLASS7746;;;Topic for fall 2014: Reproducing Greek and Roman Art Since its inception in classical antiquity the creation of art has been intricately linked to practices of copying and reproduction. This class will investigate the question from different angles, a historical, a theoretical and a practical one. The historical approach focuses on what has been called the invention of art history in connection with various techniques of replication, reproduction, imitation and appropriation. The theoretical approach will discuss notions of "original" and "copy", "authenticity" as well as the "simulacrum" within and beyond an ancient context. Finally, the practical component will entail the documentation for a database (photography, archival work, scholarly research, bibliography) and restoration of some of Cornell's plaster casts. This collection, assembled in the 19th century explicitly for an academic context and once among the largest of its kind in the United States, is today in very bad condition. The seminar is one step among many of a recently initiated research project to rescue and reappraise this precious resource.

Likewise, the mockery or destruction of these monuments is seen as a potent act of political resistance. These phenomena, together with the related concept of "propaganda," have exerted a strong influence on the interpretation of pre-modern ruler portraits. This course will encourage students to think critically about visual cultures of political rule and to develop an account of the distinctions between ancient, medieval, and modern modalities of ruler portraiture and its reception. Our primary case studies will be the late Roman and Soviet states, with ample comparative material drawn from other polities.

ARTH6510;;;Contemporary Aesthetic Theory and its Discontents;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;COML6370;GERST6510;VISST6500;;;After having been reduced to a mere ideological formation of bourgeois origin, aesthetics has recently made a strong comeback in the field of theory. This course probes the reasons for this historical change. From the arguments of the critics we will derive a catalogue of criteria for a viable aesthetics in order to examine how contemporary aesthetic theory relates to cognitive theories, the historicity of art and taste (including specific practices and institutions), and the emancipatory potentials of ethics and politics. Readings may include Adorno, Berger, de Bolla, Bourdieu, Noel Carroll, Cavell, Danto, Derrida, Dickie, Eagleton, Goodman, Guillory, Gumbrecht, Halsall, Luhmann, Lyotard, de Man, Walter Benn Michaels, Obrist, Ohmann, Scarry, Seel, Shustermann, Barbara Herrnstein Smith, Williams and others.

ASIAN1167;;;Understanding Modern China;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;HIST1670;;;As China moves forward, it often looks back to its past.  History has shaped both China's current developments and the way that many make sense of these transformations.  In surveying this history from the seventeenth century to the present, this course aims to provide an understanding of the changes, continuities, and contingencies in the making of modern China.  Topics will include the formation and fall of imperial power under the Qing Dynasty, the challenges of building a nation under the Republic, and the patterns and contradictions of social revolution under state socialism.  Attention will also be given to issues of economy, environment, ethnicity, gender, and the politics of history.  This course is open to all students and assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese culture, history, or language.
ASIAN1191;;;Introduction to Modern Asian History;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;CAPS1910;HIST1910;;;This introductory course follows the history of Asia-Pacific from the nineteenth century to the present, focusing on relations of China, India, Japan, South, and Southeast Asia.

With no expectation of covering all religious traditions present in the region, the course will cover case-studies befitting the themes at hand, overall aiming at providing students with analytical tools to understand how the nexus between state, society, and religion affects contemporary Asia. Themes addressed in the course will include: religious diversity and pluralism, debates on religious freedoms, the impact of colonialism, secularization and its opponents, the shaping of national identities, issues of ethnicity and migration, and religion as a channel to express discontent.
ASIAN2260;;;Popular Culture of Japan;;;3;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;;;;Writing-intensive course that examines and analyzes the emergence of and transitions in particular forms of culture for mass consumption in Japan. Materials range from the Tokugawa period - Japan's early modern era (1603-1868) - to the present. This course focuses on several overarching themes: media, responses to modernity, cyberspace and community, illustrated fiction and manga, and various manifestations of fandom.
ASIAN2262;;;Medicine and Healing in China;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;BSOC2261;CAPS2262;HIST2262;STS2261;;;An exploration of processes of change in medicine in China.  Focuses on key transitions, such as the emergence of canonical medicine, of Daoist approaches to healing and longevity, of Buddhist medicine and medical relief, of "Scholar Physicians," and of "traditional Chinese medicine" in modern China.  Examines the development of new healing practices in relation to both popular and specialist views of the body and disease, "cultivating vitality" practices, modes of transmission of medical knowledge, and healer-patient relations.
ASIAN2264;;;Contemporary Chinese Popular Culture;;;3;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;;;;This course will engage with some of the issues, challenges and debates that unite and divide contemporary China by critically reading and viewing works of popular culture. We will examine the commodification of Chinese culture, the kung fu tradition, popular music, and the contemporary Chinese internet. As we watch, listen and read, we will ask the following questions: what is Chinese about contemporary Chinese culture? How do the techniques of media affect the content of cultural production? And how can we read original works of Chinese popular culture to temper and test our own perceptions about China, perceptions that are themselves produced by our own national and regional cultures?
ASIAN2265;;;Beyond Kings, Palaces and Temples: Introduction to the Archaeology of South Asia;;;3;;;;;;;;;;;;ANTHR2135;ARKEO2135;;;This course will explore major themes in the archaeology of the South Asian subcontinent from the earliest palaeolithic hunter gatherers to the development of large empires in the mid first millennium CE. South Asia is an extremely diverse geographic and cultural region and we will deal with considerable regional variation: from large states and empires in some areas to foraging groups in others. The course will therefore be organized thematically, alternating between studying broad subcontinent-wide developments and examining illustrative regional case-studies. Some of the themes explored are: the beginnings of agriculture; the growth of complex political systems; and the role of inter-regional interaction. Students will be encouraged to situate the South Asian material within wider theoretical and methodological issues within archaeology and anthropology.
ASIAN2267;;;Women and Society in China;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;FGSS2267;;;This course offers a broad understanding of the active and dynamic cultural, economic, and social, and political roles played by Chinese women. By challenging the dominant stereotype of the passive and victimized Chinese woman, this course aims to examine women's struggles, negotiations, and challenges of the normative discourse of femininity and domesticity in terms of various disciplines, including philosophy, anthropology, history, and literature. Through a combination of reading original texts with secondary scholarship, this course will discuss the issues of Confucianism and patriarchal family, the female body and sexuality, education and self-expression, women's economic status and religious life, gender and the state, the modernization of women, etc.
ASIAN2268;;;Democracy and Discourse in Twentieth Century China;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;HIST2986;;;Chinese political culture has long been characterized by authoritarianism, from the time of the old imperial order up until the present Communist era. Yet the twentieth century in China witnessed a profound engagement with notions of democracy that was evident in the realms of both political discourse and political practice. This course will explore the many fascinating forms that this engagement took, from attempts to transform the Qing dynasty into a constitutional monarchy and Sun Yatsen's establishment of a short-lived republic, to May Fourth and Nationalist era debates on democracy, to movements for democratic change under Communist rule, such as the Democracy Wall Movement and the Tiananmen Square protests. The aim will be to reflect on how democracy as a political concept has been understood and used in a Chinese context and the nature of its relationship with Chinese culture.

ASIAN2275;;;History of Modern India;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;HIST2750;;;This introductory course is a broad survey of the history of the Indian subcontinent from remnants of the Mughal empire through the end of the British empire into the postcolonial present. Prominent themes include the emergence of nonviolent protest, religious and regional identities, ethnic rivalries, social reform and the "woman question," deindustrialization, nationalism and the place of democracy and militarism in a region that includes two nuclear powers, India and Pakistan.
ASIAN2298;;;The Vietnamese Wars: 1945-1990;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;HIST2890;;;This course covers the three consecutive wars fought in Vietnam from 1945 to 1990 in which France, China, the US, and the USSR, among other countries, were directly involved. The course will endeavor to look at these wars from Vietnamese perspectives as well as from the perspectives of non-Vietnamese governments. One aspect of the course will be to contextualize these wars in the global arena of international relations and the foreign policies of various countries, in particular of the United States. Another aspect will be to see how Vietnamese understood what the wars were about. How and why the events of these wars have been remembered and forgotten in the different countries involved will also be addressed.
ASIAN2299;;;Buddhism;;;3;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;RELST2299;;;This course will explore the Buddhist tradition from its origins in ancient India to its migrations throughout Asia and eventually to the West. The first part of the course will deal with Indian Buddhism: the Buddha, the principal teachings and practices of his early followers, and new developments in spiritual orientation. We will then turn to the transmission of Buddhism to Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia, where at least one of the early schools has been preserved. Next we will look at Mahayana Buddhism as it moves north and east, encompassing China, Japan, and Tibet. While much of the course will be devoted to developments in traditional times, we will also look at some of the ways Buddhist cultures have responded to modernity.
ASIAN3308;;;Issues in Contemporary China II;;;1;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;The course will be keyed to a new lecture series sponsored by the East Asia Program, bringing in high profile speakers on various aspects of contemporary China.  Students will attend several foundation-setting lectures by the instructor, then attend lectures &amp; write short assignments.
ASIAN3309;;;Temple in the World: Buddhism in Contemporary South and Southeast Asia;;;3;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;RELST3309;;;Buddhism is often thought of as a meditative and philosophical tradition, remote from the concerns and pleasures of everyday life, practical ethics, and politics. This course explores the unfolding of Buddhist life in contemporary South and Southeast Asia, in locations such as Burma, Thailand, India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, and Cambodia. We will see how the practices of meditation and philosophical reflection enter the lives of Buddhists, along with other expressions of devotion, aesthetic fascination, political action, and sociability. Our goal will be to recognize the sensual, emotional, and social qualities of Buddhist practice, and the ways in which life unfolds in a Buddhist idiom.
ASIAN3311;;;Ritual and Performance in Muslim Southeast Asia;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;Prerequisite: one course in the humanities.;;;ASIAN6611;NES3511;RELST3311;;;Structured as a seminar, this course addresses ritual performances as expressed by Muslim communities across Southeast Asia (in both minority and majority contexts), from performativity of the five pillars of Islam to special events related to the Prophet and his family, rites of passage, and shrine veneration, to name a few. The course does not require specific knowledge of Islam, nor familiarity with Arabic, as students will be introduced to the fundamentals of Islam as a religious system as well as a historical phenomenon through the exploration of rituality. Besides geographic variations across the region, themes will include the combination of performances hailing from multiple religious traditions; the existence of shared patterns of rituality between different religious traditions; the impact of transnational networks and the conversation between local and foreign vocabularies of rituality.
ASIAN3321;;;China Under Revolution and Reform;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;CAPS3403;GOVT3403;;;This course provides a broad overview of the evolution of Chinese politics from the early part of the 20th century to the present. It is roughly divided into two sections. The first traces the formation and the progression of modern state and party institutions following the collapse of the Qing Dynasty in 1911, through the communist rise to power and into the Mao era (1949-1976), culminating in the period of "opening up and reform" (1978-present). The second part of the course examines China's institutional apparatus, focusing on mapping out the government, Party, and military bureaucracies; examining relations between Beijing and the localities; and on the institutionalization of these structures and processes over time. No prior knowledge of China is required or expected.
ASIAN3325;;;Tales of Crime and Justice from Pre-Modern China;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;;;;This course examines different representations and notions of criminality and justice in a selection of Chinese historical and literary texts from early to late imperial times. These tales grapple with such questions as when lawless actions can be justified-whether regicide or banditry or petty assault-and how to accommodate competing concepts and agents of justice within the same social world. Assigned readings will be in English translation; no prior knowledge of Chinese is required.
ASIAN3326;;;Antiquity and Modernity in Contemporary China;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;;;;The class explores how Chinese over the last century have remembered and understood their past, sometimes vilifying traditional heritage and sometimes celebrating it.  We will consider broad social movements, such as the Cultural Revolution and the New Confucian revival, as well as individual events, such as the Boxer Rebellion and the 2008 Beijing Olympics, while also exploring themes of historical memory and identity.
ASIAN3329;;;Literature of Chinese Exile;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;ASIAN6639;COML3985;COML6685;;;Ever since the creation of the concept of a culturally and geographically stable center in China, people have been intentionally excluded from that center. Disgraced officials are sent to far-flung provinces, loyalists to past regimes hide out across China's borders, and dissidents have their entry visas revoked, making it impossible for them to return home. The experiences of these people, and the poems and stories they write, tell us a great deal about what it means and how it feels to be included and excluded. What is the difference between the way China looks from the inside and the way it looks from the outside? Who has the power to decide who gets to live in China, and how and why do they use it? What is the relationship between our identities and our homes? Texts studied will range from 300 BCE to the present; all will be read and discussed in English. 
ASIAN3331;;;Gender and Sexuality in Southeast Asian Cinema;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;ASIAN6631;FGSS3331;FGSS6331;LGBT3331;LGBT6331;PMA3431;RELST3331;;;Examines the new cinemas of Southeast Asia and their engagement with contemporary discourses of gender and sexuality. It pays special attention to the ways in which sexuality and gendered embodiment are at present linked to citizenship and other forms of belonging and to how the films draw on Buddhist and Islamic traditions of representation and belief. Focusing on globally circulating Southeast Asian films of the past 15 years, the course draws on current writings from feminism, Buddhist studies, affect theory, queer studies, postcolonial theory, and film studies to ask what new understandings of subjectivity might emerge from these cinemas and their political contexts. Films will be drawn from both mainstream and independent cinema and will include the work of directors such as Apichatpong Weerasethakul, Danny and Oxide Pang, Yau Ching, Thunska Pansittivorakul, Garin Nugroho, and Jean-Jacques Annaud.
ASIAN3332;;;Daoist Traditions;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;CAPS3531;HIST3531;RELST3531;;;This course will examine the modes of philosophical and spiritual inquiry, varieties of spiritual/bodily cultivation and practice, and religious organizations and movements in China that we know as Daoist (or "Taoist"). We will review debates around the labeling of these ideas and practices. We will examine the ways in which Daoism was used to contest or legitimate imperial political power, and how the procedures and ideologies of the imperial state in turn informed Daoist theory and practice. Throughout, we will consider the ways in which standard modern western dichotomies, such as sacred/secular, spiritual/physical, and mind/body, break down when we try to apply them to the study of Daoism.
ASIAN3335;;;Japan from War to Prosperity;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;HIST3300;;;An interpretation of Japanese history from the late 1920s to present, emphasizing mobilization for total war and its continuing legacies, technology and organized capitalism, relations with the United States and Asian neighbors, social integration and exclusion, historical representation and consciousness, and political dynamics.
ASIAN3337;;;Love and Identity in Early Modern China;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;ASIAN6637;;;This course will explore the culture and society of early modern China (roughly defined as covering the period from the sixteenth to the nineteenth century) through literary and visual representations related to love and identity. Along with major cultural and social transformations such as commercialization, the spread of literacy and printing, and increased social mobility, early modern China in particular witnessed the cult of love (qing). This unprecedented enchantment with love not only liberated inner emotions but also involved in the redefinition of self and the cultural and social order. Through a close reading of a variety of genres of texts, we will read major love stories as a discursive practice for constructing individual and collective identities and observing how these identities changed over time in relation to the shifting cultural, economic, social, and political situations.
ASIAN3344;;;Introduction to Indian Philosophy;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(KCM-AS);;;;;;CLASS3674;RELST3344;;;This course will survey the rich and sophisticated tradition of Indian philosophical thought from its beginnings in the speculations of Upanishads, surveying debates between Hindus, Buddhists, Jains and materialistic philosophers about the existence and nature of God  and of the human soul, the nature of knowledge, and the theory of language.
ASIAN3353;;;Mysticism in Chinese Religion;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;RELST3353;;;This course will examine techniques of spiritual cultivation in both the Daoist and Buddhist traditions of China. In particular we will compare and contrast methods which focus on the manipulation of bodily energies and fluids, particularly in the early and medieval Daoist traditions, with the Buddhist emphasis on cognitive transformation, particularly in the Chan school. Some of our discussion will also look at the debates on the nature of mystical states as "pure consciousness events" on the one hand, or culturally-specific constructions on the other.
ASIAN3363;;;Unfamiliar Encounters in Tokugawa Japan;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ASIAN6663;;;From the 1630s until Japan was forced to open its ports to the west in 1868, Japan enforced a policy of national isolation in which Japanese residents could not leave the country and "foreigners" could not enter Japan. Portrayals of 'the Other' by Japanese and of Japanese by 'the Other' take on a unique significance during this period because such representations are largely based on absence and imagination, not familiarity and fact. In this course, we will examine a variety of texts that document these encounters with the unfamiliar, including first- and secondhand non-fiction accounts, quasi-fictional illustrated novellas, theatrical portrayals of other countries, travelogues, images, and secondary literature.
ASIAN3367;;;Buddhism and its Religious Others in South and Southeast Asia;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;RELST3367;;;This course examines how Buddhist identities, communities and self-understandings are constituted in part through moments of encounter with non-Buddhists. How do Buddhists respond to the challenge of incommensurable religious diversity? What social forces restrict or expand the horizons of intelligibility, tolerance and accommodation? Focusing on the modern era, we will explore missionary work and conversion, ritual and doctrinal borrowing, hybrid communities of religious belonging, interfaith and ecumenical dialogue, and politicized or violent inter-religious conflict. We will analyze how different Buddhist actors and institutions employ diverse strategies of boundary definition and negotiation in relation to various forms of religious distinction and difference. The goal is to understand how the communal, historical and religious self-understandings of Buddhists in contemporary South and Southeast Asia have been shaped by their complicated interactions with Christian, Hindu, Muslim, animist and other religious communities.
ASIAN3383;;;Introduction to the Arts of China;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;ARKEO3800;ARTH3800;;;This course offers a survey of the art and culture of China, from the  Neolithic period to the 20th century. We begin with an inquiry into the meaning  of national boundaries and the controversy of the Han Chinese people, which  helps us identify the scope of Chinese culture. Pre-dynastic (or prehistoric)  Chinese culture is presented through both legends about the origins of the  Chinese, and scientifically excavated artifacts. Art of the dynastic and modern  periods is presented in light of contemporaneous social, political,  geographical, philosophical and religious contexts. Students work directly with  objects in the Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art.
ASIAN3388;;;Theorizing Gender and Race in Asian Histories and Literatures;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ASIAN6688;COML3980;COML6680;FGSS3580;FGSS6580;;;For a long time area studies have overlooked the questions of gender, race/ethnicity, and social class in fields related to East Asia and the trans-Pacific regions. Little attention has been paid to how to conceptualize gender and race/ethnicity; how to analyze the mutual implication of sexism, racism, and class essentialism (some call it "class racism"), and how to understand the relationships of these topics to the broader contexts of colonialism, imperialism, and nationalism. This course is designed to offer a series of discussions about the following problems: (1) the historically specific modes of sexism and racism in social spaces related to Japan and other places in the trans-Pacific; (2) the mutual implication of sexism, racism, and social class in various contexts including those of colonialism, imperialism, and nationalism; (3) the roles of gender, race, and social class in the United States' knowledge production about East Asia in general; and (4) the conceptions of gender and race in the social formations particular to East Asia. The assigned readings include both English and Japanese materials. However, those who register in ASIAN 3388 are exempt from reading the materials in Japanese.
ASIAN3396;;;Southeast Asian History from the Eighteenth Century;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;HIST3960;;;Surveys the modern history of Southeast Asia with special attentions to colonialism, the Chinese diaspora, and socio-cultural institutions. Considers global transformations that brought "the West" into people's lives in Southeast Asia. Focuses on the development of the modern nation-state, but also questions the narrative by incorporating groups that are typically excluded. Assigns primary texts in translation.

ASIAN4402;;;Asian Studies Honors: Senior Essay;;;4;;;Fall, spring.;;;;;;Prerequisite: admission to honors program.;;;;;;The student, under faculty direction, prepares an honors essay.
ASIAN4403;;;Supervised Reading;;;1-4;;;Fall, spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;Intensive reading under the direction of a member of the staff.
ASIAN4404;;;Supervised Reading;;;1-4;;;Fall, spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;Intensive reading under the direction of a member of the staff.
ASIAN4411;;;History of the Japanese Language;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;Prerequisite: reading knowledge of Japanese.;;;JAPAN4410;LING4411;;;Overview of the history of the Japanese language followed by intensive examination of issues of interest to participants. Students should have reading knowledge of Japanese.
ASIAN4416;;;Gender and Sexuality in Southeast Asia;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ASIAN6618;FGSS4160;FGSS6160;HIST4160;HIST6160;LGBT4160;LGBT6160;;;Students consider the relationships among colonialism and gender and sexual identity formation in Southeast Asia. Using material from a wide range of fields including anthropology and literature, the course complicates the simplistic East/West and male/female binary. Each year the course is offered, its emphasis shifts to adapt to changes in the fields of gender, sexuality and Asian Studies. It incorporates theoretical literature and content that is broader than that of Southeast Asia.
ASIAN4425;;;Representing Eros: Thailand;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ASIAN6625;FGSS4415;FGSS6625;LGBT4425;LGBT6625;;;This course investigates the ways in which gender, sexuality, and desire have been thought of, written about, and depicted in Thailand as well as in the global imaginary about the country. While it draws also on historical cases, the course is primarily interested in examining key questions regarding sexuality, embodiment, and desire in the contemporary public sphere in Thailand. Thematic foci include notions of temporality, globalization, liberalism, space, nationalism, policy, and Buddhism. Students are encouraged to use the course to further develop their own research projects.
ASIAN4430;;;Structure of Korean;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(KCM-AS);;;Prerequisite: KOREA 1102 or linguistics course.;;;KOREA4430;LING4430;;;Intensive examination of the syntax and phonology of a non-Indo-European language with the objective of testing principles of current linguistic theory.
ASIAN4434;;;Shi'i Islam in Southeast Asia;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;Prerequisite: one course on Islam/Middle Eastern studies or permission of instructor.;;;ASIAN6634;NES4634;RELST4434;;;Structured as a seminar, this course explores various aspects of Shi'i Islam (in cultural, literary, intellectual, ritual, legal, and political terms) in its historical emergence and contemporary manifestations across Southeast Asia. Departing from an analysis of forms of devotion towards the 'Alid members of prophet Muhammad's family (scriptures and ritual), class discussions will address issues such as constructions of sectarian identities (Sunni versus Shi'i), the role of transnational flows in shaping Shi'i communities across the region, Muslim-majority governments' reactions to the emergence of such communities, and broader debates on orthodoxy and 'deviation' (both within and between Islamic traditions). Although lectures at the beginning will cover the historical process by which Shi'i Islam came into shape, this will be pursued critically, and students are expected to have foundational knowledge of Islam's theology and history.
ASIAN4440;;;Bodies at the Border;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ASIAN6640;COML4339;COML6339;FGSS4339;FGSS6339;LSP4339;LSP6339;;;Although the wounded, often feminine, body is the most powerful way of imagining border space in both the Indian subcontinent and the Americas, it is seldom coupled with the embodied practices and performances through which borders define everyday life and shape geographical and historical consciousness in the two regions. Drawing upon texts, media, and theory generated from South Asia and Latin America, the course will develop new comparative approaches to the constitutive role that bodies play in creating, maintaining, and imagining borders in the global South.
ASIAN4449;;;History and Methods of the Academic Study of Religion;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(KCM-AS);;;Prerequisite: two courses in religious studies or permission of instructor.;;;RELST4449;;;This course provides advanced students in Religious Studies or the humanities a working familiarity with important methodological issues in the academic study of religion. Following a brief historical outline of the development of the academic study of religion, we will survey major approaches to the academic study of religion currently used and discussed in Religious Studies today. We will read representative and seminal works from the following approaches to the study of religion: anthropology, philosophical hermeneutics, phenomenology, history of religions, the sociology of religion and critical ideological studies. For each of these cases, we will see how these studies both build upon the nineteenth century assumptions of the nature of religion and have addressed twentieth century religious and theoretical issues. For each of the texts we will be reading, we will try to grasp why particular approaches had the appeal they did when they did. The course operates as an intellectual history of the rise of the study of religion as an academic (as opposed to confessional) subject.
ASIAN4454;;;Gangnam Style: Seoul and its Layered Histories;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;VISST4454;;;This course will take an interdisciplinary, dynamic and experimental approach to study the Seoul city within the larger context of spatial discourses in history, urban culture, literature and visual media.   It will provide students with a tour of this emerging cityscape as it developed from a royal/imperial capital (1392-1910) to a colonial one (1910-45), before becoming the economic hub of a divided peninsula (1945-present).  Seoul, the capital of South Korea, has in the past several years emerged as a truly global cosmopolitan city, boldly aspiring to be the "Center of the World" ("Chongno segye ui chungsim i toeja") and a 21st century "Design City." With a population of 12 million, congested streets, and soaring skyscrapers, Seoul has become an important socioeconomic, political, and cultural center, both within Northeast Asia and throughout the globe. However, underneath the glitter of modernity and globalization visible in the urban sprawl of contemporary Seoul are forgotten stories, stratified claims, and a tumultuous history which Japanese rule, a civil war, and US military presence.  We will examine Seoul's symbolic place in the world community as seen through the 1988 Olympics and how its minorities make this city their home. Special attention will be given to the entrance of technologies, the transformation of architectural spaces, and the emergence of new subjectivities.  By the end of the course, students will not only become familiar with Seoul's past, but also learn important concepts informing the burgeoning field of Korean studies.
ASIAN4461;;;China's Early Modern;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;ASIAN6661;CAPS4963;HIST4963;HIST6963;;;Theories of modernization have inspired, informed, and plagued the historiography of late imperial China.  Comparative studies have variously found and sought to explain in the Song-Qing eras an absence of modernization, modernization earlier than Europe's, or alternative paths of modernization. Regional models argue for trans-East Asian systems and patterns of modernization. Global models have argued that China had a vital role in Europe's modernization as a provenance of modernizing institutions and ideas, as a source of exploited resources, or otherwise as an integral part of global systems. In this course we will explore these historiographical debates and develop critical perspectives, including approaches to escaping Eurocentric and teleological frameworks.
ASIAN4466;;;Religious Nationalism and Political Violence in South and Southeast Asia;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;Prerequisite: one course in ANTHR, ASIAN, HIST, RELST, at the 3000-level or above or permission of instructor.;;;ASIAN6666;RELST4466;RELST6666;;;This course examines how religious ideologies, practices and institutions have been politically mobilized in the public spheres of modern South and Southeast Asia. Divisive social conflict and communal violence have resulted from this mobilization, challenging conventional secular notions of national identity and political community. How have nationalist, developmental and democratic agendas in the post-colonial era contributed to the emergence of assertive, contentious religious identities? How have religious beliefs, communities, and historical memories been transformed by this mobilization? In what ways have these visions of religious nationalism transformed the political, economic and social dynamics of the post-colonial states of South and Southeast Asia? We will examine a variety of cases including Hindutva and communal violence in India, ethno-religious chauvinism and civil war in Sri Lanka, the Saffron Revolution and anti-Muslim campaigns in Burma, and religious insurgency in Thailand.
ASIAN4470;;;Modernity in East Asia;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;;;;An introduction to the comparative study of social, political, and intellectual modernity in East Asia and the North Atlantic. The course will examine the characteristics of East Asian modernity with much emphasis on the relationship between colonialism and modernity. We will focus on the problems of historical time and language, and read the philosophical and sociological works of the 20th century in order to understand the ways in which cultural activities and the modalities of identification were transformed during the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries. The questions of the civilizing mission and national subjectivity will play central roles in this course.
ASIAN4477;;;Beauty and Violence in Korean Film;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;;;;Korean film and literature of the modern and contemporary eras are juxtaposed between two identifiable tropes - the beautiful, tranquil Orient and a violent, frenetic hyper-modernity.  This arises from a tension between how Koreans want to identify themselves and their modern historical experiences, and from the ways the international community and the "West" sees them - as the exotic "East."   Seeking to understand yet also complicate this dichotomy, the course will explore how the two Koreas have struggled to hone a national identity, and the problems inherent in the process.  We will analyze the imagination and construction of national identity and cultural tradition (and its critique) in Korean film and literature, but also strive to understand how Korea has been struggling since the 1990s to overcome the national in the face of overwhelming globalization.  No Korean language ability is required; no background knowledge in Korean history or culture is assumed; all films are subtitled in English.
ASIAN4481;;;Translation and Cultural Difference;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(KCM-AS);;;;;;COML4700;;;Problems concerning translation are explored. Although there are many different models of translation, we tend to be confined to the unilateral regime of translation, that is, the very narrow and historically specific mode of translation as a transnational transfer of significance between two national or ethnic languages. This course will survey theories of translation with special emphasis on relationships between trans-national translation and transnational transference. Translation establishes a division of two spheres and thereby marks the limit of what can be expressed in one medium. Broadly understood, translation can take place not only between two national languages but also at a variety of boundaries within a single society. We will investigate different economies of translation by which different social and cultural identities are constructed, emphasizing the disappearance of multi-lingualism in the modern nation-state and the mutation of translation tropics which has given rise to new ways of imagining the organicist unity of the society. Historical transformation of translation accompanying the genesis of linguistic and cultural identity will be examined in reference to historical materials. Furthermore, the course will explore the broader conception of translation in terms of which to critically understand communication as the ideology of Capital.
ASIAN4484;;;Contemporary Taiwanese Art;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;ARTH4840;ARTH6840;ASIAN6684;VISST4840;;;Contemporary Taiwanese Art is defined in this course as the art of Taiwan since the 1980s. The 1980s was a crucial transformative period in Taiwan's history when the island underwent major social and political changes. Art as part of this transformation was fully engaged in reshaping the images of Taiwan, revealing moment-to-moment social reconstruction. With internationalization policies and the effects of globalization, the island has undergone further rapid and dramatic transformations since the 2000s. These changes are also revealed in works by younger generations of artists. In this research seminar, participants will select research topics at the beginning of the semester as their final research paper projects, and through weekly meetings, we will refine and delve into each selected topic deeply.
ASIAN4490;;;Understanding Korean History;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;ASIAN6690;;;This upper level/ graduate seminar explores the field of Korean History through an examination of major scholarship.  It is meant to complement courses like "Approaches to Modern Chinese History" (HIST 6640/ASIAN 6641) in the China field, and is designed primarily for graduate students preparing for their A examinations, for general East Asia scholars who might be asked to teach Korea in the future, and for undergraduates with prior background in Korean Studies.   We will move through the major issues in Korean historiography, using the most important recent English language scholarship on Korea.  Topics will include but not be limited to Neo-Confucianism, social movements, modernity, nationalism, colonialism, economic development, gender, history of science, and regionalism.  We will place particular emphasis on mapping out the field in terms of key controversies and debates in the field of Korean Studies, such as premodern slavery, Koryo-Choson dynastic change, foundation myths, nascent capitalism, modernization theory, colonial modernity, collaboration, revisionist history of the Korean War, the Park Chung Hee Era, minjung ideology, and contemporary politics.   Students will be expected to work together as the reading list is significant. 
ASIAN5505;;;Methodology of Asian Language Learning and Teaching;;;2;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;Presents theories of language teaching and learning, and shows how they apply to Asian language course structure, classroom instruction, and assessment techniques.  Students will observe classes taught by experienced teachers, discuss language learning theory and practice, and design and implement their own class activities.  This course is a requirement for all graduate students slated for a Teaching Assistant position in Chinese, Hindi and Urdu, Japanese, and Korean languages.
ASIAN6611;;;Ritual and Performance in Muslim Southeast Asia;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;Prerequisite: one course in the humanities.;;;ASIAN3311;NES3511;RELST3311;;;Structured as a seminar, this course addresses ritual performances as expressed by Muslim communities across Southeast Asia (in both minority and majority contexts), from performativity of the five pillars of Islam to special events related to the Prophet and his family, rites of passage, and shrine veneration, to name a few. The course does not require specific knowledge of Islam, nor familiarity with Arabic, as students will be introduced to the fundamentals of Islam as a religious system as well as a historical phenomenon through the exploration of rituality.

ASIAN6613;;;Southeast Asian Bibliography and Research Methods;;;1;;;Spring.;;;;;;Recommended prerequisite: reading knowledge of at least one SE Asian language or other Asian language and a major European language.;;;;;;Covers practical bibliographical skills and research methods necessary to accomplish quality research in the field of Southeast Asian Studies.  During the semester we will explore resources available at the Cornell University Libraries, those provided through Library subscription, and resources available elsewhere.
ASIAN6618;;;Gender and Sexuality in Southeast Asia;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;ASIAN4416;FGSS4160;FGSS6160;HIST4160;HIST6160;LGBT4160;LGBT6160;;;Students consider the relationships among colonialism and gender and sexual identity formation in Southeast Asia.

Thematic foci include notions of temporality, globalization, liberalism, space, nationalism, policy, and Buddhism. Students are encouraged to use the course to further develop their own research projects.
ASIAN6629;;;Contemporary Studies of Japan;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;The class is conducted in the Japanese language but the reading assignments are mostly in English. This course is offered to help graduate students meet the new demands of contemporary East Asian studies. These demands are summarized under three headings: (1) a shift in what is expected of scholarship on East Asia, (2) the intellectual and cultural situation surrounding Asian Studies, and (3) the change in the disciplines in their modus operandi in the Humanities. Here, what is meant by the 'contemporaneity' of knowledge production means the dialogic mode of inquiry in which students do not investigate or speak on the exotic objects of their inquiry but address to and speak with the intellectuals /scholars working and studying in East Asia as interlocutors.
ASIAN6631;;;Gender and Sexuality in Southeast Asian Cinema;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;ASIAN3331;FGSS3331;FGSS6331;LGBT3331;LGBT6331;PMA3431;RELST3331;;;Examines the new cinemas of Southeast Asia and their engagement with contemporary discourses of gender and sexuality. It pays special attention to the ways in which sexuality and gendered embodiment are at present linked to citizenship and other forms of belonging and to how the films draw on Buddhist and Islamic traditions of representation and belief. Focusing on globally circulating Southeast Asian films of the past 15 years, the course draws on current writings from feminism, Buddhist studies, affect theory, queer studies, postcolonial theory, and film studies to ask what new understandings of subjectivity might emerge from these cinemas and their political contexts. Films will be drawn from both mainstream and independent cinema and will include the work of directors such as Apichatpong Weerasethakul, Danny and Oxide Pang, Yau Ching, Thunska Pansittivorakul, Garin Nugroho, and Jean-Jacques Annaud.

ASIAN6639;;;Literature of Chinese Exile;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;ASIAN3329;COML3985;COML6685;;;Ever since the creation of the concept of a culturally and geographically stable center in China, people have been intentionally excluded from that center. Disgraced officials are sent to far-flung provinces, loyalists to past regimes hide out across China's borders, and dissidents have their entry visas revoked, making it impossible for them to return home. The experiences of these people, and the poems and stories they write, tell us a great deal about what it means and how it feels to be included and excluded. What is the difference between the way China looks from the inside and the way it looks from the outside? Who has the power to decide who gets to live in China, and how and why do they use it? What is the relationship between our identities and our homes? Texts studied will range from 300 BCE to the present; all will be read and discussed in English.
ASIAN6640;;;Bodies at the Border;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;ASIAN4440;COML4339;COML6339;FGSS4339;FGSS6339;LSP4339;LSP6339;;;Although the wounded, often feminine, body is the most powerful way of imagining border space in both the Indian subcontinent and the Americas, it is seldom coupled with the embodied practices and performances through which borders define everyday life and shape geographical and historical consciousness in the two regions. Drawing upon texts, media, and theory generated from South Asia and Latin America, the course will develop new comparative approaches to the constitutive role that bodies play in creating, maintaining, and imagining borders in the global South.
ASIAN6641;;;Approaches to Modern Chinese History;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;HIST6640;;;This graduate seminar examines developments in the field of modern Chinese history from the postwar to the present. Through the critical reading of scholarship both classic and contemporary, we will familiarize ourselves with the main historiographical debates that have shaped the field, and think through the process and politics in the writing of modern Chinese history. We will also discuss ways that these debates can be brought into the classroom for undergraduate teaching. In addition, students will work together with the instructor to design research projects of their own, and to situate these in the driving questions of the field. Background knowledge of modern Chinese history required.
ASIAN6661;;;China's Early Modern;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;ASIAN4461;CAPS4963;HIST4963;HIST6963;;;Theories of modernization have inspired, informed, and plagued the historiography of late imperial China.  Comparative studies have variously found and sought to explain in the Song-Qing eras an absence of modernization, modernization earlier than Europe's, or alternative paths of modernization. Regional models argue for trans-East Asian systems and patterns of modernization. Global models have argued that China had a vital role in Europe's modernization as a provenance of modernizing institutions and ideas, as a source of exploited resources, or otherwise as an integral part of global systems. In this course we will explore these historiographical debates and develop critical perspectives, including approaches to escaping Eurocentric and teleological frameworks.
ASIAN6663;;;Unfamiliar Encounters in Tokugawa Japan;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;ASIAN3363;;;From the 1630s until Japan was forced to open its ports to the west in 1868, Japan enforced a policy of national isolation in which Japanese residents could not leave the country and "foreigners" could not enter Japan. Portrayals of 'the Other' by Japanese and of Japanese by 'the Other' take on a unique significance during this period because such representations are largely based on absence and imagination, not familiarity and fact. In this course, we will examine a variety of texts that document these encounters with the unfamiliar, including first- and secondhand non-fiction accounts, quasi-fictional illustrated novellas, theatrical portrayals of other countries, travelogues, images, and secondary literature.
ASIAN6666;;;Religious Nationalism and Political Violence in South and Southeast Asia;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;Prerequisite: one course in ANTHR, ASIAN, HIST, RELST, at the 3000-level or above or permission of instructor.;;;ASIAN4466;RELST4466;RELST6666;;;This course examines how religious ideologies, practices and institutions have been politically mobilized in the public spheres of modern South and Southeast Asia. Divisive social conflict and communal violence have resulted from this mobilization, challenging conventional secular notions of national identity and political community. How have nationalist, developmental and democratic agendas in the post-colonial era contributed to the emergence of assertive, contentious religious identities? How have religious beliefs, communities, and historical memories been transformed by this mobilization? In what ways have these visions of religious nationalism transformed the political, economic and social dynamics of the post-colonial states of South and Southeast Asia? We will examine a variety of cases including Hindutva and communal violence in India, ethno-religious chauvinism and civil war in Sri Lanka, the Saffron Revolution and anti-Muslim campaigns in Burma, and religious insurgency in Thailand.
ASIAN6682;;;Flux Navigations: Biopolitics and Urban Aesthetics in the Contemporary SE Asian City;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;ARCH6308;SHUM6308;;;This course critically addresses accounts of Southeast Asia's port and delta metropolises as sites of economic and cultural transformation as part of recent power shifts in the region. It focuses on the socio-spatial problematics associated with collision between old and new forms of labor, capital, and governance in urban environments where the impacts of climate change are increasingly evident. Part of the Mellon Collaborative Studies in Architecture, Urbanism, and the Humanities, the seminar will be pedagogically linked to a parallel Expanded Practice Graduate Design Studio in Architecture whose goal is to explore meta-issues in global urbanism.
ASIAN6684;;;Contemporary Taiwanese Art;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;ARTH4840;ARTH6840;ASIAN4484;VISST4840;;;Contemporary Taiwanese Art is defined in this course as the art of Taiwan since the 1980s. The 1980s was a crucial transformative period in Taiwan's history when the island underwent major social and political changes. Art as part of this transformation was fully engaged in reshaping the images of Taiwan, revealing moment-to-moment social reconstruction. With internationalization policies and the effects of globalization, the island has undergone further rapid and dramatic transformations since the 2000s. These changes are also revealed in works by younger generations of artists.  In this research seminar, participants will select research topics at the beginning of the semester as their final research paper projects, and through weekly meetings, we will refine and delve into each selected topic deeply.
ASIAN6688;;;Theorizing Gender and Race in Asian Histories and Literatures;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;Prerequisite: reading knowledge of Japanese.;;;ASIAN3388;COML3980;COML6680;FGSS3580;FGSS6580;;;For a long time area studies have overlooked the questions of gender, race/ethnicity, and social class in fields related to East Asia and the trans-Pacific regions. Little attention has been paid to how to conceptualize gender and race/ethnicity; how to analyze the mutual implication of sexism, racism, and class essentialism (some call it "class racism"), and how to understand the relationships of these topics to the broader contexts of colonialism, imperialism, and nationalism. This course is designed to offer a series of discussions about the following problems: (1) the historically specific modes of sexism and racism in social spaces related to Japan and other places in the trans-Pacific; (2) the mutual implication of sexism, racism, and social class in various contexts including those of colonialism, imperialism, and nationalism; (3) the roles of gender, race, and social class in the United States' knowledge production about East Asia in general; and (4) the conceptions of gender and race in the social formations particular to East Asia. The assigned readings include both English and Japanese materials. However, those who register in ASIAN 3388  are exempt from reading the materials in Japanese.
ASIAN6690;;;Understanding Korean History;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;ASIAN4490;;;This upper level/ graduate seminar explores the field of Korean History through an examination of major scholarship.  It is meant to complement courses like "Approaches to Modern Chinese History" (HIST 6640/ASIAN 6641) in the China field, and is designed primarily for graduate students preparing for their A examinations, for general East Asia scholars who might be asked to teach Korea in the future, and for undergraduates with prior background in Korean Studies.   We will move through the major issues in Korean historiography, using the most important recent English language scholarship on Korea.  Topics will include but not be limited to Neo-Confucianism, social movements, modernity, nationalism, colonialism, economic development, gender, history of science, and regionalism.  We will place particular emphasis on mapping out the field in terms of key controversies and debates in the field of Korean Studies, such as premodern slavery, Koryo-Choson dynastic change, foundation myths, nascent capitalism, modernization theory, colonial modernity, collaboration, revisionist history of the Korean War, the Park Chung Hee Era, minjung ideology, and contemporary politics.   Students will be expected to work together as the reading list is significant.

ASRC1500;;;An Introduction to Africana Studies: Blackness in Global and Transnational Perspective;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;AMST1500;GOVT1503;;;At the inception of this department at Cornell University in 1969, the ASRC became the birthplace of Africana studies and is now an institution increasingly defining the "new Africana studies." Africana studies is a discipline that has been increasingly universalized in academia and that emphasizes comparative and interdisciplinary studies of Africa, the U.S., the Caribbean and other diasporas.  In this course, we will look at the diverse contours of the discipline and draw on resources from the humanities and social sciences. We will explore contexts ranging from modernity and the Trans-Atlantic slave trade and plantation complex in the New World to processes of decolonization and globalization. Within this framework, we will also consider the concept of race and notions of racial formation and newer concepts such as "post-blackness." We will consider how blackness as a concept shapes cultural flows and exchanges in the global context and saliently impacts popular culture. Topics that we will explore include history, literature, music, art, education, politics, religion, economics, health and the prison industrial complex.
ASRC1590;;;History and Popular Culture;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;HIST1590;;;This course uses a multidisciplinary approach to explore the complex relationship between history and popular culture in Africa. The course considers two main questions - How can you write history using popular culture? And how do artists use history to create popular culture? It uses examples from around the continent to explore old and new forms of popular culture; forms of cultural expression used by historians; as well as the ways in which artists use moments of great historical significance or key historical actors in their works. We consider, for example, the work of Leroy Vail who used songs by Mozambican peasants to write a social history of colonialism as well as films about colonialism by African film-makers such as the late Ousman Sembene.
ASRC1790;;;History of the Caribbean: From Conquest to Revolution;;;4;;;;;;;;;;;;HIST1970;;;What is the Caribbean? How did its native inhabitants fared in the aftermath of the arrival of Europeans? How did the region shift from a Spanish Lake to a heavily contested geopolitical site where all European powers vied for political and commercial superiority? What were the main production systems of the region and how did they result in dramatic environmental change? How did the eighteenth-century revolutions transform the Caribbean? In this introductory survey to Caribbean history we will answer these and many other questions through the study of the political, economic, social, cultural, and environmental transformations of the Caribbean from the arrival of Columbus to the era of the Haitian Revolution. We will follow indigenous people, Spanish conquistadors, English, Dutch, and French pirates and privateers, planters, and merchants, imperial officers, slaves, sailors, and revolutionaries as they adapted to the multiple transformations that shaped this region. Through lectures, discussions, and readings of primary and secondary sources we will navigate the Caribbean in a quest to understand the historical processes that gave shape to this tropical paradise.

This course introduces students with research interests in Latino and Africana Studies to search strategies and methods for finding materials in various formats (e.g., digital, film, and print) using information databases such as the library catalog, print and electronic indexes, and the World Wide Web. Instructors provide equal time for lecture and hands-on learning. Topics include government documents, statistics, subject-specific online databases, social sciences, the humanities, and electronic citation management.
ASRC2003;;;Africa: The Continent and Its People;;;3;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;;;;Introductory interdisciplinary course focusing on Africa's geographical, ecological, and demographic characteristics; indigenous institutions and values; the triple cultural heritage of Africanity, Islam, and Western civilization; main historical developments and transitions; and contemporary political, economic, social, and cultural change. Africa's ties with the United States (from trans-Atlantic slavery to the present), its impact on the emerging world order, and its contribution to world civilization are also explored.
ASRC2020;;;Introduction to African Philosophy;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;PHIL2525;;;The central questions of philosophy are perennial and universal. But the answers that are given to them are always historical and idiomatic.  This course aims to introduce its enrollees to how these questions have been answered in the global African world made up of, specifically Africans, African Americans, and peoples of African descent in the African Diaspora; how they have thought about and sought to make sense of or solve some of the same philosophical problems that have remained at the core of the "Western" tradition. The readings for the course are chosen from a global African perspective. This does not mean that we will not read any of the 'traditional' texts. What it means is that we will be yielding the pride of place to much maligned and characteristically absent from the "mainstream" philosophical traditions and the ideas of people that are not normally considered worthy of study in the American academy. We wish to broaden our repertoire so that, at the end of the class, our knowledge will reflect the comparative perspectives that studying different traditions can offer while at the same time giving us access to the wisdom of peoples other than our own.
ASRC2101;;;Intermediate Swahili I;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;Prerequisites: ASRC 1100 and ASRC 1101.;;;;;;Intermediate Swahili class uses your Elementary Swahili fluency through learning activities inside and outside the class.

ASRC2105;;;Arabic for Heritage Speakers;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;NES2203;;;This course is designed for students who can speak and understand a spoken Arabic dialect (Egyptian, Lebanese, Syrian, Iraqi, etc.) but have little or no knowledge of written Arabic, known as Classical Arabic, Modern Standard Arabic, or Fusha. The focus of the course will be on developing the reading and writing skills through the use of graded, but challenging and interesting materials. As they develop their reading and writing skills, students will be learning about Arab history, society, and culture. Classroom activities will be conducted totally in Arabic. Students will not be expected or pressured to speak in Classical Arabic, but will use their own dialects for speaking purposes. However, one of the main goals of the course will be to help the development of the skills to communicate and understand Educated Spoken Arabic, a form of Arabic that is based on the spoken dialects but uses the educated vocabulary and structures of Fusha.
ASRC2110;;;Intermediate Yoruba I;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;Prerequisite: ASRC 1109.;;;;;;The intermediate course extends the development of the main language skills-reading, writing, listening, and conversation.

ASRC2204;;;Introduction to Quranic Arabic;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;Prerequisite: knowledge of Arabic alphabet.;;;NES2204;RELST2204;;;This course is designed for students who are interested in reading the language of the Qur'an with accuracy and understanding. The first week (4 classes) will be devoted to an introduction of the history of the Qur'an: the revelation, collection, variant readings, and establishment of an authoritative edition. The last week will be devoted to a general overview of "revisionist" literature on the Qur'an. In the remaining 12 weeks, we will cover all of Part 30 (Jus' 'Amma, suuras 78-114) and three suuras of varying length (36, 19, and 12).
ASRC2260;;;Music of the 1960s;;;3;;;;;;;;;;;;AMST2260;MUSIC2260;;;In this class, we will examine how musicians working in such genres as rock, jazz, folk, classical, soul, and experimental music responded and contributed to the major themes of the 1960s in the US: the counterculture, Vietnam, the civil rights movement, women's liberation, and the space race. We will examine written texts, recordings, and films from the period. The ability to read music is not required.
ASRC2352;;;Paul Robeson and the Revolutionary Imagination;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;AMST2352;HIST2352;;;Radical activist and artist Paul Robeson was one of the most beloved and persecuted black men in American history. His life, writing, artistic production, and iconic image helped shape political and artistic movements in the U.S. and beyond from the 1930s to the 1950s. Robeson was not only the first black man to play Othello on Broadway, he was also a key figure in black freedom movements, anticolonial movements, and labor movements in the first half of the twentieth century. From the Popular Front era of the 1930s through the arid political climate of the 1950s, Robeson's activism inspired, propelled, and expanded freedom movements in the U.S. and abroad. This course will examine Robeson's life as a way of understanding those movements.
ASRC2504;;;Obama and the Meaning of Race;;;3;;;Spring.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;GOVT2604;SOC2520;;;The election of Barack Obama to the presidency has raised new questions in the American debate on race, politics, and social science. Has America entered a post-racial society in which racism and inequality are things of the past? Or does Obama's post-Black, race-neutral approach to governing signal the end of Black politics, race-based activism and prescriptive policy? In this course, students will use the Obama presidency to think, talk, and write about how race works in America. We'll examine the symbolism of Obama's personal narrative and biracialism to analyze his race-neutral campaigns and governing within the context of history, politics, and policies. We'll look at the public image of Michelle Obama, especially how she is gendered as Black radical and fashionista.
ASRC2506;;;Africa from Partition to the Postcolonial State;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;GOVT2503;;;The title of this survey course refers to three specific moments in the history of Africa: the partition of Berlin (1884), the advent of neo-colonialism as independence (1960); and the post-structural adjustment 'failure' of the postcolonial state. It centers around The Congo, which stands as the symbol of this African crisis of modernity both as the geographic heart of Africa, one subject to imperial geopolitical games, and also the symbol of the 'darkness' that Africa has become to its foreign protectors, trustees, and mandatory powers, other interventionists - states and non-state entities alike.
ASRC2542;;;The Making of Contemporary Africa;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;HIST2542;;;Most people learn about Africa through the media.  However, media critics note that coverage is disproportionately skewed toward negative stories - poverty, war and corruption. While these factors are a reality for too many people on the continent, media observers note that too often the coverage lacks context and breadth.  Furthermore, media outlets do not report positive developments even where they exist.  This course will provide some of the depth and context necessary to understand events in contemporary Africa.  The first two-thirds of the course will examine African social and economic history since the nineteenth century - Africa's integration in the international economy, the rise of new social classes, the creation of the colonial state and the post-colonial state.  Our primary examples will be drawn from  East, West and Southern Africa to highlight both the similarities and differences of their historical development.  The final third of the course will examine several contemporary issues in which scholars and journalists have attempted to address the weaknesses in general press coverage.
ASRC2650;;;Introduction to African American Literature;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;AMST2650;ENGL2650;;;This course will introduce students to the African American literary tradition. Through aesthetic and contextual approaches, we will consider how African American life and culture has defined and constituted the United States of America. From slave narratives to Hip-Hop music, we will trace the range of artistic conventions and cultural movements while paying close attention to broader historical shifts in American life over the past three centuries. We will ask: How do authors create and define a tradition? What are some of the recurring themes and motifs within this tradition? Authors will include: Phillis Wheatley, David Walker, Frederick Douglass, Ida B. Wells-Barnett, W.E.B. DuBois, Zora Neal Hurston, Lorraine Hansberry, James Baldwin, Audre Lorde, Toni Morrison, and Paul Beatty.
ASRC2670;;;History of Modern Egypt;;;3;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;HIST2672;NES2670;;;This lecture class will explore the socio-cultural history of modern Egypt from the late 18th century to the 21st century "Arab Spring." We will explore Egyptian history under the Ottomans and the Mamluks, the unsuccessful French attempts to colonize Egypt, and the successful British occupation of the country. We will then examine the development of Egyptian nationalism from the end of the 19th century through Nasser's pan-Arabism to the 2011 Egyptian Revolution. We will accomplish this with the aid of a variety of texts and media, including novels and films.
ASRC2674;;;History of the Modern Middle East: Nineteenth to Twentieth Centuries;;;3;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;GOVT2747;HIST2674;JWST2674;NES2674;;;This course examines major trends in the evolution of the Middle East in the modern era. Focusing on the 19th and 20th centuries and ending with the  "Arab Spring," we will consider Middle East history with an emphasis on five themes: imperialism, nationalism, modernization, Islam, and revolution.  Readings will be supplemented with translated primary sources, which will form the backbone of class discussions.
ASRC2950;;;The African Diaspora in Contemporary Latin America;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;LATA2950;;;The course explores the many contributions of the African Diaspora in contemporary Latin America. The nineteenth and twentieth centuries offered new opportunities and equally daunting challenges for Latin America. In many countries, African-descended people fought in the wars of Independence but found that they rarely reaped the benefits that newly established freedom from a European metropole offered to others. And yet, attempts at marginalization and disenfranchisement could not stifle the impact of the African Diaspora in Latin America. From music and film to social movements and religious expression, we examine how African-descended people made long-lasting and significant changes to the social, cultural, political, and economic landscapes of Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Cuba, and the Andean region.

While today Brooklyn is New York City's hippest borough and the site of swift gentrification, booming real estate, and the ever-escalating displacement of immigrant and Black communities, in the 1980s and 1990s it was a hotbed of hip hop music, making the borough synonymous with Black cultural production. New York's most populous borough is still the home of the nation's most concentrated Black population. This course borrows from hip hop's notion of "representing" to explore popular and cultural understandings of race and place in Brooklyn as depicted in print, music, and film. How is Brooklyn represented? What do these representations reveal about Black cultural production, inequality and transnational identity formation more broadly speaking? Spanning the period from 1945 to the present day, emphases will include the grassroots movements of the 1960s-1970s, the commodification of hip hop in the 1980s-1990s, and close readings of iconic Brooklyn films such as Spike Lee's "Do the Right Thing," to reflect on how Black popular culture engages with Brooklyn's many ethnic groups. While materials are interdisciplinary in approach, our investigation is informed by anthropological, historical, and literary texts covering topics including immigration, transnationalism, gentrification, and gendered and racialized inequality. Texts include Marshall's Brown Girl, Brownstones; Mose Brown's Raising Brooklyn: Nannies, Childcare, and Caribbeans in Creating Community; Bailey's Jay-Z: Essays on Hip Hop's Philosopher King; Osman's The Invention of Brownstone Brooklyn: Gentrification and the Search for Authenticity in Postwar New York; and LaBennett's She's Mad Real: Popular Culture and West Indian Girls in Brooklyn.
ASRC3031;;;Race and Revolution in the Americas: 1776-1900;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;AMST3032;HIST3031;LATA3031;;;This course will examine the "age of democratic revolutions" in the Americas from the perspective of the Black Atlantic. During this momentous era, when European monarchies were successfully challenged and constitutional governments created, Blacks fomented their own American revolutions both in the outside of evolving "New World democracies." This course examines the black trajectory in British North America, Latin America, the French (especially Haiti,) the British and the Spanish Caribbean. The course begins with black participation in the U.S. independence War (1776-1781) and concludes with black (non-U.S.) participation in the independence wars against Spain. The course will also briefly address post-emancipation race relations in these American countries.

ASRC3205;;;Thinking Black Intellectuals;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;;;;"Thinking Black Intellectuals" departs from the premise that there is always, in one form or another, a "crisis" - or, a question about the "role" of the intellectual. However, in the conception of this course, the intention is not to address this issue. Instead, the course seeks to "demonstrate" the act of, properly speaking, Black intellectual thinking. By reading a series of texts, from Black scholars in philosophy such as Valentin Mudimbe to the renowned African-American theologian and preacher, Gardner C. Taylor, from the artistic oeuvre of Fela Kuti to the interventionist work of Angela Davis, this course will engage the thought of Black intellectuals. What, the guiding question will be, does it mean to think, specifically, or not, as a Black intellectual?
ASRC3400;;;Being and Becoming Black;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;AMST3402;ANTHR3400;LSP3400;;;This course is about being Black throughout the Atlantic world. What constitutes Blackness? What experiences, cultural understandings and social problems shape the identities of people of African descent? In order to address these questions, the course focuses on the people who were relocated by the Atlantic slave trade to the Caribbean, South and Central America, and the United States, and on their subsequent migrations. We will explore the disparate cultural, national, historical and intellectual contexts in which Black identities are constructed, revealing both commonalities and differences. Paying specific attention to how racial identity is shaped by social context, the course will interrogate theories of Black identity formation and notions of Black nationhood, and will examine different perspectives on Diaspora theory. While readings are interdisciplinary in approach, our understandings of Blacks in the Atlantic world will be informed by ethnographic, historical and literary texts covering many cultural contexts including the U.S., England, Kenya, South Africa, Haiti, Puerto Rico, Brazil, Jamaica and the Dominican Republic. Students are urged to choose research topics early in the term from a variety of subjects including music, fashion, religion, literature, politics, sports, etc.
ASRC3505;;;Blaxploitation Film and Photography;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;AMST3515;ARTH3505;FGSS3505;PMA3505;VISST3505;;;Blaxploitation films of the 1970s are remembered for their gigantic Afros, enormous guns, slammin' soundtracks, sex, drugs, nudity, and violence. Never before or since have so many African American performers been featured in starring roles. Macho male images were projected alongside strong, yet sexually submissive female ones. But how did these images affect the roles that black men and women played on and off the screen and the portrayal of the black body in contemporary society? This interdisciplinary course explores the range of ideas and methods used by critical thinkers in addressing the body in art, film, photography and the media. We will consider how the display of the black body affects how we see and interpret the world by examining the construction of beauty, fashion, hairstyles and gendered images as well as sexuality, violence, race, and hip-hop culture.
ASRC3550;;;Modeling Race, Fashioning Beauty;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;AMST3560;FGSS3540;;;Using written and visual biographies as a starting point, this class follows African and African American women in the fashion industry to explore perceptions of beauty, race, gender and class. Contemporary television, global fashion and rigorous cultural studies will be intertwined as students discuss cultural standards of beauty, and ultimately, compose self-narratives defining their own relationship with fashion, appearance and self-image.
ASRC3590;;;The Black Radical Tradition in the U.S.;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;AMST3590;HIST3590;;;This course provides a critical historical interrogation of what Black Marxism author Cedric Robinson called "the Black Radical Tradition." It is designed to introduce students to some of the major currents in the history of black radical thought, action and organizing, with an emphasis on the United States after World War I. It relies on social, political and intellectual history to examine the efforts of black people who have sought not merely social reform, but a fundamental restructuring of political, economic and social relations. We will define and evaluate radicalism in the shifting contexts of liberation struggles. We will explore dissenting visions of social organization and alternative definitions of citizenship, progress and freedom. We will confront the meaning of the intersection of race, gender, class and sexuality in social movements.
ASRC3740;;;Contemporary African American Poetry;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;AMST3742;ENGL3740;;;This course will examine a variety of voices in contemporary African American poetry, focusing on works produced in the decades following the Civil Rights and Black Power Movements. We will consider how new generations of black poets are using verse to represent personal and collective history; to interrogate race and other social categories like gender and sexuality; and to ungate new perspectives for understanding the human condition. Along with verse, we will also study other forms of poetry like Hip Hop and spoken word that inform the contemporary African American lyric. Authors will include Rita Dove, Yusef Komunyakaa, Elisabeth Alexander, Natasha Trethewey, Terrance Hayes, and Lyrae Van Clief-Stefanon.
ASRC3860;;;African American Social History, from 1910 to the Present: Race, Work, and the City;;;4;;;Fall or spring.;;;;;;;;;AMST3860;HIST3760;ILRLR3860;LAW7060;;;Examines the experience of black Americans from the start of the Great Migration just before World War I. Topics include the effects of migration on work experiences and unionization patterns, the impact of depression and two world wars on black social structure and economic status, the growth of the Civil Rights movement, and the impact of migration and urbanization on a variety of social and cultural institutions.

ASRC4291;;;Marriage and Divorce in Africa;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;FGSS4291;HIST4291;;;Marriage was the widely expected norm within African societies. The institution was an important marker of adulthood, linking individuals and lineages in a network of mutual cooperation and support. Marriage practices and the concomitant gender expectations varied significantly between societies, and over time. As a result, marriage and divorce are especially rich terrain for exploring social history, women's agency, discursive constructions of 'women', masculinity and gender relations of power. This course explores some of the newest scholarship on marriage by Africanist scholars. The readings demonstrate the wide cultural variety in marriage as well as the dynamic relationship between marriage and historical change. They especially highlight women's roles and expectations in marriage, masculinity and the ways men and women negotiated the rules and boundaries of marriage.
ASRC4304;;;Critical Race Theory: On Race and Law in the United States;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;ASRC6340;;;It is almost a truism that the United States is the world's most litigious society. As a polity founded on an almost sacralized constitutional foundation, it is no surprise that law and the legal system are quite central to life, its conceptions, and its manifestations, as understood and led by most inhabitants of the country. This, in turn, engenders a faith in law and its attendant justice on the part of Americans. This faith encompasses certain attitudes on the part of different segments of the American populace towards legal discourse, the operation of the legal system, the justice promised by law, and so forth. In this class, we shall be exploring these diverse issues from the standpoint of Critical Race Theory. We seek to establish what CRT is and its genesis; what it does and how it does what it does, and what justification we might have or can provide for studying it. At the end of the class, participants should have a fairly robust idea of CRT, its fundamental claims, its applicability, and what insights it provides regarding the nature, function, and aims of law and the legal system in the United States of America.
ASRC4390;;;Reconstruction and the New South;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;AMST4039;ASRC6391;HIST4390;HIST6391;;;This course focuses on the American South in the nineteenth century as it made the transition from Reconstruction to new forms of social organization and patterns of race relations. Reconstruction will be considered from a sociopolitical perspective, concentrating on the experiences of the freed people. The New South emphasis will include topics on labor relations, economic and political changes, new cultural alliances, the rise of agrarianism, and legalization of Jim Crow.
ASRC4393;;;The Underground Railroad and the Coming of the Civil War;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;AMST4393;HIST4393;HIST6393;;;In 1850 American politicians banded together cross-regionally, passed a Fugitive Slave Law and breathed a sigh of relief, thinking they had once again dodged the slavery issue that threatened disunion. This "Bloodhound Bill" was designed to make "slave" catchers of all Northern whites. Instead it set in motion waves of protests, transformed previously silent whites into underground conductors, further emboldened veteran underground workers and forced thousands of self emancipated Northern blacks to emigrate. The Underground Railroad contributed to convincing Southerners that the Government would not or could not protect slavery. This course examines underground activism beginning in 1850 and offers an interpretation of how the Underground Railroad led to emancipation. The ebbs and flows of underground activity; transnational networks; Civil War military and geo-political issues; and what W.E.B. DuBois called the "General Strike" all contributed to making the Thirteenth Amendment a foregone conclusion.
ASRC4402;;;Women in Hip Hop;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;AMST4402;AMST6402;ANTHR4102;ANTHR7102;ASRC6402;FGSS4402;FGSS6402;LGBT4402;LGBT6402;;;This course will explore how women are portrayed in hip hop music and culture, addressing women both as consumers and producers. We will draw on texts that analyze misogyny in hip hop music and music videos, while also looking at how both mainstream and marginalized female hip hop artists contest sexually exploitative images of women. The course will utilize Black feminist theory, consumption theory, and youth culture theory to help students interpret and critique the ways in which women are represented in hip hop music, art, fashion, and dance, and in its surrounding culture. Considering analyses of African American, Caribbean, Asian-American, South African, and Latino interactions with hip hop, the course will investigate how youth construct gender and ethnic identities as they negotiate notions of African Diasporic belonging vis-a-vis hip hop. We will employ ethnographic, historical, sociological, literary, and interdisciplinary texts to explore questions such as: What do the sexual politics of rap music reveal about broader gender constructions? How can we compare the portrayal of women in hip hop to representations of women in related musical genres?  How are hetero-normative gender ideologies reinforced in hip hop culture? Does hip hop allow a space for alternative femininities? The course will also address broader questions related to representations of Black femininity, minorities in the media, gender and sexual identity construction.
ASRC4403;;;Black Women Writers of the South;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;ASRC6403;ENGL4603;FGSS4403;FGSS6403;;;This course considers the new generation of writers of black women that has emerged in the U.S. South in more recent years, whose writings have increasingly impacted the development of contemporary African American literature. Genres that we will explore include the novel, poetry and essay and memoir. We will consider a range of authors, including Tayari Jones, Shay Youngblood, Honoree Jeffers, and Natasha Tretheway. Concomitantly, we will explore the visual art of Kara Walker. We will consider ways in which these writers build upon established themes and conventions in African American and black women's writing and the implications of their work for black feminist theory.   Furthermore, we will examine the impact of their work within the emergent field of twenty-first century African American literature and criticism.
ASRC4404;;;The Black 70s: From Black Politics to Black Popular Culture;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;AMST4404;AMST6404;ASRC6404;;;Using film, primary documents, literature, art, and secondary sources, this course explores the ten-year period between the assassination of Martin Luther King in 1968 and 1978, when The Supreme Court case, Regents of the University of California v. Bakke upheld the constitutionality of affirmative action, but imposed limitations on it to ensure that providing greater opportunities for minorities did not come at the expense of the rights of the majority. This decade marks one of the most turbulent periods in American history and radical changes impacting the political, religious, artistic, legal and educational cultures of Black people occurred during the period. For the most part we take these changes for granted without giving much thought to their origins. Through a variety of readings, discussions, and research papers, and through the screening of documentaries, the course aims to explore and arrive at a deeper understanding of the major events of the period and to understand how structural issues impacted the lives of African Americans, as well as how they responded to these upheavals. We will then seek to understand how that period relates to today.
ASRC4503;;;Picturing the U.S. Slave Narrative;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;ENGL4503;;;Before the advent of technologies like Facebook and Twitter, nineteenth-century viewers used new visual technologies-like collectible card-photographs and illustrated newspapers-to share information or publically debate social problems. In an effort to garner support for slavery's abolition, U.S. anti-slavery activists embraced "illustrations," "scenes," and "pictures," as key rhetorical tools, using them to provide "ocular proof" of slavery's horrors and abolition's necessity. Via hands-on interaction with nineteenth-century images, and classroom study of slave narratives, illustrated newspapers, and photo-texts, we will pinpoint how visual images transformed not only the nineteenth-century slave narrative, but also its many literary after-lives. By reading nineteenth-century visual culture against more contemporary representations of slavery like Toni Morrison's 1988 novel Beloved, Kyle Baker's 2005 graphic novel, Nat Turner, and Steve McQueen's 2014 Academy-Award Winning film Twelve Years a Slave, we'll revise how we define a key genre in American literary studies.
ASRC4516;;;Sociology of Race & Education;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;ASRC6516;SOC4520;SOC6510;;;We will undertake an in-depth study of racial inequality and its relationship to schooling. The course content is centered primarily on the schooling challenges facing Black, Latino, Asian, and Native American students. We will investigate how issues such as the resegregation of schools, academic tracking, and teacher quality impact student achievement. The course reviews classic theoretical perspectives in the sociology of education, including education as social reproduction or cultural capital. Special attention will be given to the conceptualization and measurement of racial gaps in standardized test scores since the 1970s. We will also give some attention to how the debates surrounding race and education are influenced by popular discourse, including film documentaries.
ASRC4587;;;Critical Race Theory;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;AMST4587;AMST6587;ASRC6587;GOVT4578;GOVT6578;;;A political theory seminar that deals primarily with the conceptual and normative questions pertaining to racism and racial identity in the United States context.  Although the precise reading list will vary from year to year, the major figures and commentators may include W.E.B. Du Bois; Frederick Douglass; Booker T. Washington; Ida B. Wells; Charles Hamilton Houston; Thurgood Marshall; Hortense Spillers; Cornel West; Michael Dawson; Robin Kelley; Robert Gooding-Williams; Tommie Shelby; Cristina Beltran; Gary Okihiro; Gerald Torres; Rogers Smith; and Aziz Rana. The theme for 2015 will be African-American political thought and the "Long Civil Rights Movement." Ideally, students will have some background in African American studies and/or American political thought. Strong preference will be given to seniors and graduate students.
ASRC4602;;;Women and Gender Issues in Africa;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;ASRC6602;;;There are two contrasting views of the status and role of women in Africa. One view portrays African women as controlled by men in all social institutions. Another view projects women as having a relatively favorable position in indigenous societies they were active with an identity independent of men's and no concentration of women in a private sphere while men controlled the public sphere. This course examines critical gender theories and women in historical and contemporary periods. The topics covered include: non-westernized/pre-colonial societies; the impact and legacy of colonial policies; access to education and knowledge; women in politics and the economy in local and global contexts; women's organizations; armed conflicts and peace; same gender love and evolving family values; the law and health challenges; the United Nations and World Conferences on Women: Mexico 1975, Copenhagen 1980, Nairobi 1985, Beijing 1995 and post-Beijing meetings, and the 2010 superstructure of UN Women.
ASRC4606;;;The Family and Society in Africa;;;4;;;Fall, summer.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;ASRC6066;SOC4780;;;"The family, as a social institution, is structured according to historical, socio-economic, political, and cultural factors. Course topics include the concepts of the nuclear and extended family, the roles, rights and obligations of different age groups and generations; and marriage and its related issues, including parenthood, childrearing, and gender roles. Other issues examined are reproductive health, family planning, sexuality and fertility (particularly during adolescence), family codes, and legal implications. The course deals also with structural change and continuity, the impact of westernization, urbanization, formal education, and the contemporary economy on the structure and challenges of the family in Africa. Finally, the legacy of African family values and traditions in the African Diaspora, with a focus on the African-American experience, is discussed."
ASRC4701;;;Africa in the African American Mind;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;AMST4701;HIST4701;;;This seminar examines some of the political and cultural visions of Africa and Africans held by African-American intellectuals and activists in the 19th and 20th centuries. Emphasis is placed on the philosophies of black nationalism, Pan Africanism and anticolonialism and the themes of emigration, expatriation, repatriation and exile. Awareness of Africa and attitudes toward the continent and its peoples have profoundly shaped African-American identity, culture and political consciousness. Notions of a linked fate between Africans and black Americans have long influenced black life and liberation struggles within the U.S. The motives, purposes and outlooks of African-American theorists who have claimed political, cultural, or spiritual connection to Africa and Africans have varied widely, though they have always powerfully reflected black experiences in America and in the West. The complexity and dynamism of those views belie simplistic assumptions about essential or "natural" relationships, and invite critical contemplation of the myriad roles that Africa has played in the African-American mind."
ASRC4800;;;Black Queer Studies;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;ASRC6800;FGSS4801;FGSS6801;LGBT4800;LGBT6800;;;This course traces the genealogies and animating debates in black queer studies. Attentive to the relationship between black feminist criticism and black queer theory, this class proceeds with an understanding of gender and sexuality as intrinsic to the study of blackness in global contexts. Readings will include essays and books from Audre Lorde, E. Patrick Johnson, Christina Sharpe, Robert Reid Pharr, and others. Students will also engage popcultural texts, such as films, music videos, and novels to address the conjecture of blackness and sexuality in critical and vernacular discourse.
ASRC4805;;;Race & Racism/Law & Society;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;AMST4800;AMST6800;ASRC6805;GOVT4805;GOVT6805;;;A seminar that examines contemporary dilemmas in the construction of race and ethnicity in law, and the racialized construction of social problems and governmentality. We will examine classics in the field and new works, including those by Gerald Torres and Lani Guinier, Dorothy Roberts, Michelle Alexander, Jack Balkin, Derrick Bell, Osagie Obasojie, and the famous legal studies anthologies on critical race theory and law and society edited by Richard Delgado and Jean Stenfancic; and Kimberle Crenshaw, Neil Gotanda, Gary Peller, and Kendall Thomas. The issues that we will explore include: mass incarceration; the history and meaning of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; the social construction of race and ethnicity; the intractable character and historicity of white domination; and the history of black "cause lawyering."  Strong preference will be given to graduate students, law students, and undergraduates with previous coursework in the field.

As we focus on African artists and theorists, we also read American and European theorists, including but not certainly limited to Giorgio Agamben, Michel Foucault, Roland Barthes, and Joseph Slaughter, detecting the ways in which discourses around bodies in the African context may shape contemporary theories and vice versa.

ASRC6600;;;Education and Development in Africa;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;EDUC5020;;;In the 1950s and 1960s, the human capital theory that emphasizes the importance of formal education for achievement of full productive potential of individuals and economic growth and development of countries enjoyed a renewed popularity. African countries promoted educational expansion with the expectation that it would lead to socio-economic development. The initial euphoria, however, was followed by skepticism and then disillusion.  Education, as it was being organized, delivered, received, and utilized, began to be perceived even as a hindrance to development. The course examines the relationship between formal education and individual and national development. Different paradigms of development, including modernization and dependency theories, and Third World Forum, are discussed with an emphasis on the perceived and actual roles of education in individual and national development. The issues to be discussed include education and schooling, the role of primary, secondary, and higher education in development, the problems of employment, language, equity in access and results with a focus on gender, race, and social class. Case studies, including selected countries of the different African sub-regions, will be used for illustration.

Genetic engineering (recombinant DNA technology) is one class of methods used in biotechnology. Private sector firms are actively marketing transgenic crops and other products of biotechnology globally. The public sector has been somewhat less active, but is becoming increasingly involved in transgenic technologies, particularly in less-industrialized countries. Developmental questions begin with those we ask of all technology: at whose cost, to whose benefit? Social movements have arisen to block both the testing and commercializing of biotechnology products, arguing that the developmental consequences are negative. Their objections center on the issues of food sovereignty, effects of land use change on the environment, ownership of transgenic traits and the genetic background in which they are placed (intellectual property), environmental uncertainties/risks, control of the food supply by multinational corporations and human health issues.

In this course, students will be learning about and seeing cutting-edge research in modern laboratories. Critically, they will see what the practice of science is like. The course will have three modules, each centered on the lab of a different Cornell faculty member. First, there will be a lecture by the STEM faculty member on their research that is targeted to the freshmen audience and emphasizes the importance of work, its application, and the process of discovery and exploration that is intrinsic to the research. During the ~2 weeks following the lecture, students in the course will spend a one day shadowing graduate students and post-docs in the STEM faculty member's lab. Students will write a short description of what they saw and how it relates to the broader goals of the lab they learned about from the lecture. After all students have shadowed, there will be a second meeting that includes the students, and the scientists they shadowed, and the STEM faculty member. The focus of this second meeting will be discussing the experiments they saw, how they worked, how those measurements connect to the bigger picture goals for the laboratory and the project, as well as the nature of the relationships among the graduate students, post-docs, and faculty that enable this research. Finally, students will read and critically analyze a paper from the faculty member's lab, with a third and final meeting to discuss how this final scientific product relates to the people, experiments, and process of science they saw in the lab and discussed. These activities will give students incredible insight into how science is done and its inherent excitement.

BSOC1941;;;The History of Science in Europe: From the Ancient Legacy to Isaac Newton;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;HIST1941;STS1941;;;How did the approaches to knowledge of nature that developed in medieval and early-modern Europe create an enterprise that associated the practical manipulation of nature with scientific truth? This course surveys intellectual approaches to the natural world from the theologically-shaped institutions of the Middle Ages to the Scientific Revolution of the 16th and 17th centuries. Ancient Greek authors such as Aristotle and Archimedes were used in diverse ways that came to usher in an era of European global expansion. By the late 17th century, a new kind of practically applicable science attempted to demonstrate Francis Bacon's famous claim that "knowledge is power."
BSOC2051;;;Ethical Issues in Health and Medicine;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(KCM-AS);;;;;;STS2051;;;In today's rapidly changing world of health and medicine, complex ethical issues arise in many contexts from the private, interpersonal interactions between doctor and patient to the broad, mass-mediated controversies that make medicine into headline news. This course examines ethical problems and policy issues that rise in contemporary medicine, health care, and biomedical research. Tools for ethical research are applied to a variety of topics and fundamental questions in bioethics. Perspectives from social science, history, and law also inform the course, which will consider ethical issues in their social and institutional context. We will explore problems that arise in a number of substantive areas, including the doctor-patient relationship, end-of-life decision making, distributive justice and health care, human experimentation, reproductive technology, public health, and human genetics. The course will also examine the relatively new field of bioethics itself, raising questions about what issues count as ethical ones and exploring the role of ethical expertise in contemporary societies. This course is also designated as a University Course.  Please visit blogs.cornell.edu/universitycourses/ for further information.
BSOC2061;;;Ethics and the Environment;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(KCM-AS);;;;;;PHIL2460;STS2061;;;Politicians, scientists, and citizens worldwide face many environmental issues today, but they are neither simple nor straightforward. Moreover, there are many ways to understand how we have, do, and could value the environment from animal rights and wise use to deep ecology and ecofeminism. This class acquaints students with some of the challenging moral issues that arise in the context of environmental management and policy-making, both in the past and the present. Environmental concerns also highlight important economic, epistemological, legal, political, and social issues in assessing our moral obligations to nature as well as other humans. This course examines various perspectives expressed in both contemporary and historical debates over environmental ethics by exploring four central questions: What is nature? Who counts in environmental ethics? How do we know nature? Whose nature?
BSOC2071;;;Introduction to the History of Medicine;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;HIST2710;STS2071;;;This course offers an introductory survey of the history of medicine (principally in Europe and the United States) from classical antiquity to the early twentieth century. Using a combination of both primary and secondary sources, students will learn about the "Hippocratic Heritage" of contemporary western medicine; medicine in late antiquity; faith and healing in the medieval period; medicine and knowledge in the Islamic world; medicine during the Renaissance (particularly the rise of the mechanical philosophy); medicine in the age of Enlightenment; professionalization, women-doctors and midwives, and battles over 'quackery' in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries; the role of medicine in colonialism and empire; and the promises and perils of modern medicine (dramatic decreases in mortality on the one hand, the rise of Eugenics and the importance of Medicine to the National Socialist State on the other). As well as this temporal survey, we will consider a number of ongoing themes: race, bodily difference, and medicine; medicine and the environment; women, gender, and medicine; the history of the body; the history of sexuality; and the close connections between forms of social order and forms of medical knowledge.

BSOC2122;;;Darwin and the Making of Histories;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;HIST2122;STS2122;;;The power of a name is sometimes as great as that of an idea. This course will study who Darwin was in his own time, and how he became, then and now, an icon rather than just a Victorian naturalist. We will look at writings of Darwin himself, and attempt to understand what they meant in their own time, how Darwin came to write them, and how his contemporaries helped to shape their future.  How did Victorian ideologies of gender, race, and class shape the production and reception of Darwin's work? We will also examine the growth of "Darwinism" as a set of broader social and cultural movements, particularly in Britain and the United States. Were eugenics movements examples or perversions of Darwinism?  Finally, we will consider how Darwin's name has been used by more recent evolutionary biologists such as Steven Jay Gould, and by American anti-evolutionists.
BSOC2141;;;The Biological Basis of Sex Differences;;;3;;;Fall.;;;(PBS);;;Prerequisite: one college-level biology course or permission of instructor.;;;BIOAP2140;BIOMS2140;FGSS2140;;;Examines the structural and functional differences between the sexes.

BSOC2261;;;Medicine and Healing in China;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;ASIAN2262;CAPS2262;HIST2262;STS2261;;;An exploration of processes of change in medicine in China.  Focuses on key transitions, such as the emergence of canonical medicine, of Daoist approaches to healing and longevity, of Buddhist medicine and medical relief, of "Scholar Physicians," and of "traditional Chinese medicine" in modern China.  Examines the development of new healing practices in relation to both popular and specialist views of the body and disease, "cultivating vitality" practices, modes of transmission of medical knowledge, and healer-patient relations.
BSOC2350;;;Literature and Medicine;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;ENGL2350;FGSS2350;LGBT2350;;;How does literary language depict the experience of physical suffering? Can a poem or a novel palliate pain, illness, even the possibility of death? From darkly comic narratives of black plague and accounts of early modern melancholy to twentieth century critiques of the mental institution and depictions of the AIDS crisis, this course examines literature centered on medical practices from the early modern period through the twentieth century. Why have medical practices changed, and how do writers address their political, social, and ideological implications? Readings will include a broad range of genres, including poetry (Coleridge, Whitman), fiction (McEwan, Chekhov, Gilman, Kafka), theater (Kushner), nonfiction prose (Defoe, Woolf), and critical theory (Scarry, Canguilhem, Sontag).
BSOC2468;;;Medicine, Culture, and Society;;;3;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ANTHR2468;STS2468;;;Medicine has become the language and practice through which we address a broad range of both individual and societal complaints. Interest in this "medicalization of life" may be one of the reasons that medical anthropology is currently the fastest-growing subfield in anthropology. This course encourages students to examine concepts of disease, suffering, health, and well-being in their immediate experience and beyond. In the process, students will gain a working knowledge of ecological, critical, phenomenological, and applied approaches used by medical anthropologists. We will investigate what is involved in becoming a doctor, the sociality of medicines, controversies over new medical technologies, and the politics of medical knowledge. The universality of biomedicine (or hospital medicine) will not be taken for granted, but rather we will examine the plurality generated by the various political, economic, social, and ethical demands under which biomedicine has developed in different places and at different times. In addition, biomedical healing and expertise will be viewed in relation to other kinds of healing and expertise. Our readings will address medicine in North America as well as other parts of the world. In class, our discussions will return regularly to consider the broad diversity of kinds of medicine throughout the world, as well as the specific historical and local contexts of biomedicine.
BSOC2581;;;Environmental History;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;AMST2581;HIST2581;;;This lecture course serves as an introduction to the historical study of humanity's interrelationship with the natural world. Environmental history is a quickly evolving field, taking on increasing importance as the environment itself becomes increasingly important in world affairs. During this semester, we'll examine the sometimes unexpected ways in which "natural" forces have shaped human history (the role of germs, for instance, in the colonization of North America); the ways in which human beings have shaped the natural world (through agriculture, urbanization, and industrialization, as well as the formation of things like wildlife preserves); and the ways in which cultural, scientific, political, and philosophical attitudes toward the environment have changed over time. This is designed as an intensely interdisciplinary course: we'll view history through the lenses of ecology, literature, art, film, law, anthropology, and geography. Our focus will be on the United States, but, just as environmental pollutants cross borders, so too will this class, especially toward the end, when we attempt to put U.S. environmental history into a geopolitical context. This course is meant to be open to all, including non-majors and first-year students.
BSOC2681;;;Environmental Issues in the Contemporary Middle East;;;3;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;GOVT2583;JWST2687;NES2687;;;Centrally located between two continents; the Middle East is drawn by nature to many environmental challenges that are re-lated to its unequal distribution of natural resources associated with its geological setting, mosaic ethnic composition, and cultural diversity. Such environmental background sets the need for an essential understanding of challenges that faces the area and is likely fundamental to its survival.

BSOC2821;;;Science in Western Civilization: Newton to Darwin, Darwin to Einstein;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;HIST2820;STS2821;;;This course aims to make comprehensible both to science majors and to students of the humanities the historical  structure and development of modern science and to show sciences as cultural phenomena. Changing perceptions of nature and human knowledge from Greek Antiquity to the twentieth century form the framework for current Western views of the world, while the roots of the present-day dominance of "science" as a symbol of progress and modernity lie in an alliance between knowledge of nature and power over nature that took shape in the nineteenth century after a long period of emergence. This course covers the eighteenth, nineteenth, and early twentieth centuries.  
BSOC3011;;;Life Sciences and Society;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;STS3011;;;Biology and biotechnology are major sources of influence on personal and social life. In addition, social and historical conditions have profound influence on biological research,and on the applications of such research in medicine, agriculture, and other fields. Biological research itself is a social process involving personal and commercial competition, different styles of work and interpretation, and complex human interactions. The course aims to introduce students to basic science and technology studies (S&amp;TS) perspectives on biological knowledge and biotechnology. Students will be encouraged to critically evaluate and discuss these perspectives. The course is designed to prepare students for more advanced courses in the Biology &amp; Society and S&amp;TS majors, but students who do not plan to take further courses in those subjects can get critical insight into biology's profound role in shaping our modern way of life.
BSOC3111;;;Sociology of Medicine;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;DSOC3111;SOC3130;STS3111;;;This course provides an introduction to the ways in which medical practice, the medical profession, and medical technology are embedded in society and culture. We will ask how medicine is connected to various sociocultural factors such as gender, social class, race, and administrative cultures. We will examine the rise of medical sociology as a discipline, the professionalization of medicine, and processes of medicalization and demedicalization. We will look at alternative medical practices and how they differ from and converge with the dominant medical paradigm. We will focus on the rise of medical technology in clinical practice with a special emphases on reproductive technologies. We will focus on the body as a site for medical knowledge, including the medicalization of sex differences, the effect of culture on nutrition, and eating disorders such as obesity and anorexia nervosa. We will also read various classic and contemporary texts that speak to the illness experience and the culture of surgeons, hospitals, and patients, and we will discuss various case studies in the social construction of physical and mental illness.
BSOC3311;;;Environmental Governance;;;3;;;Fall.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;DSOC3311;DSOC6320;NTRES3311;NTRES6310;STS3311;;;Environmental governance is defined as the assemblage of institutions that regulate society-nature interactions and shape environmental outcomes across a range of spatial and temporal scales.  Institutions, broadly defined, are mechanisms of social coordination including laws (formal) and social norms (informal) that guide the behavior of individuals.  Participants in the course will explore the roles of governments, markets, and collective action in environmental management and mismanagement. We will emphasize interactions among leading environmental policy strategies: public regulation, market-based incentives, and community-based resource management. The course is focused around a set of analytic perspectives.  These theoretical frameworks allow us to synthesize empirical observations and material changes in ways that inform our understanding of contemporary evolution of environmental policy and management.

BSOC4291;;;Politics of Science;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;GOVT4291;STS4291;;;This course examines scientific controversies that become political. Why does some science become politicized rather than normalized and routinized? How do societies deal with collective uncertainty and risk entailed in authoritative scientific findings? How do social movements respond to niches in contentious knowledge to expand influence? To what extent is science made politically vulnerable by its commitment to incremental evidence-based knowledge in contention with junk science? What do interest-based explanations of politics tell us and leave out? An archetypal case is climate change, but it is one of many. Topics range broadly and will be adjusted to student interests.
BSOC4303;;;The GMO Debate: Science and Society;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;BIOPL4303;CSS4303;GOVT4303;IARD4303;PLBR4303;STS4303;;;Biotechnology is a broad term for the tools used to alter living organisms for human purposes. Genetic engineering (recombinant DNA technology) is one class of methods used in biotechnology. Private sector firms are actively marketing transgenic crops and other products of biotechnology globally. The public sector has been somewhat less active, but is becoming increasingly involved in transgenic technologies, particularly in less-industrialized countries. Developmental questions begin with those we ask of all technology: at whose cost, to whose benefit? Social movements have arisen to block both the testing and commercializing of biotechnology products, arguing that the developmental consequences are negative. Their objections center on the issues of food sovereignty, effects of land use change on the environment, ownership of transgenic traits and the genetic background in which they are placed (intellectual property), environmental uncertainties/risks, control of the food supply by multinational corporations and human health issues. Students will evaluate the legitimacy of various arguments and political positions relative to scientific findings and cultural norms. They will seek to understand the dimensions of political contention: what is at stake? Why does the controversy reach global dimensions? What are the concrete interests involved?

CAPS4030;;;Issues in China Studies;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;;;;This course serves as the wrap-up seminar for CAPS students.  It is designed for CAPS seniors to review the critical issues and topics in China and Asia-Pacific Studies from broader theoretical perspectives, to engage in academic discourse and policy debate about implications of China rising, to reflect on their four-year learning experience in Ithaca, Washington, D.C., and Beijing as students of contemporary China studies, and to enhance their abilities to pursue future studies and/or careers that are related to their CAPS experience after graduating from Cornell.  The seminar is organized around the central theme - China rising - and roughly divided into three sections:  (1) China's rise and the "paradigm change" in world politics; (2) China's quest for identity and order; and (3) implications of China rising for the U.S. and the world.  Under each of these sections, a few specific topics are identified for class discussion.
CAPS4963;;;China's Early Modern;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;ASIAN4461;ASIAN6661;HIST4963;HIST6963;;;Theories of modernization have inspired, informed, and plagued the historiography of late imperial China.  Comparative studies have variously found and sought to explain in the Song-Qing eras an absence of modernization, modernization earlier than Europe's, or alternative paths of modernization. Regional models argue for trans-East Asian systems and patterns of modernization. Global models have argued that China had a vital role in Europe's modernization as a provenance of modernizing institutions and ideas, as a source of exploited resources, or otherwise as an integral part of global systems. In this course we will explore these historiographical debates and develop critical perspectives, including approaches to escaping Eurocentric and teleological frameworks.

We will begin with a survey of various forms of Bibli-cal and post-Biblical Second Temple writings. These texts will serve to establish the literary frameworks against which the rabbinic genres form. We will then explore the Mishanh, the Tosefta, and the Palestinian and Babylonian Talmuds. Through an exploration of the development of parallel themes, we will come to an understanding of how and when these texts evolved. Finally, we will explore a number of Midrashic compilations and assess their historical settings as well as their literary and ideological relationships to the two Talmuds. All Texts will be read in translation.

CLASS3770;;;Constantinople/Istanbul, 330-1566;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;ARKEO3370;ARTH3270;MEDVL3270;NES3270;RELST3270;VISST3270;;;Ancient Byzantion, rebuilt and renamed by the Roman emperor Constantine the Great, raised by his successors to be the capital of a "Byzantine" empire, object of desire for travelers and crusaders, crowning conquest of the Ottoman sultan Mehmet: the city on the Bosporus stands at the center of the late antique, medieval, and early modern Mediterranean. We will consider its urban development from ancient polis to modern metropolis, its marvels of religious architecture from the Hagia Sophia to the Suleymaniye, the splendor of its residences from the Great Palace of the Byzantine Emperors to the Topkapi Sarayi, and the daily life of its humbler residents from the games of the Hippodrome to the taverns and brothels.
CLASS4602;;;Pygmalion: Aesthetics of Touch;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;ARTH4956;SHUM4997;VISST4956;;;"Please Do Not Touch" is one of the signs we are most accustomed to seeing in art museums, yet the very need to make this request demonstrates how objects often invite, seek, even demand that we transgress the limits of vision and engage with them physically. In the Pygmalion myth, the artist's creating hand and the viewer's desire to touch come together in a fantasy of union with the object that has been endlessly appropriated and reimagined in later Western culture. Focusing on Classical art, this course explores the role of touch and embodiment in the viewing and reception of art objects, drawing on ancient models of sense-perception as well as 20th Century theorists such as Reigl, Berenson and Merleau-Ponty.  
CLASS4604;;;Perfection, Objectivity and Sensation in Philosophy of Art;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;GERST4996;PHIL4596;SHUM4996;VISST4996;;;A graduate level discussion of the role of sensation in philosophy of art, and its relation to conceptions of objectivity and perfection. We'll aim to transform our understanding of a range of issues raised within traditional philosophy of art (for example, in the work of Plato, Aristotle, Aquinas, Hume, Kant, Nietzsche and Heidegger) by drawing upon relevant contemporary approaches in metaphysics, theory of knowledge and philosophy of mind.
CLASS4625;;;Change in Late Antiquity;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;CLASS6625;HIST4825;HIST6825;RELST4825;;;In the fourth century C.E. the Roman emperors decided to favor Christianity and shortly thereafter to forbid non-Christian activity. The 'end of paganism' however did not occur all at once if it ever did. This seminar will focus on the approaches to the problem of Christianization and on its documentation. Through readings and discussion, we will chart the transformations of the Roman world from 250 to 600 C.E.
CLASS4636;;;Gnosticism and Early Christianity;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;JWST4628;NES4628;RELST4628;;;What is "Gnosticism" and why has it come to be so hotly debated among scholars and in our contemporary media? What is the Gospel of Judas and are its ideas "heretical"? Who wrote the Gospel of Thomas and the Gospel of Mary and why were these Gospels not included in the New Testament canon? To what extent did Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code draw from ancient Christian gnostic sources? This seminar will explore answers to these questions and many others by focusing on the complex array of literary sources from late antiquity-primarily from a cache of manuscripts found at Nag Hammadi, Egypt, in 1945-that have long been associated with a so-called "Christian Gnosticism." Church Fathers condemned the "movement" on a variety of grounds, but in this course we will not simply read the condemnations written by the opponents of gnostic thought; rather, we will focus our attention on reading (in English translation) substantial portions of the "gnostic" texts written by the adherents themselves. We will give special attention to the ways in which conflicts about Gnosticism connected with conflicts about gender, heresy, power, and authority. To set these texts within a socio-historical context, we will discuss the possible Jewish and hellenistic roots of early Christian Gnosticism and ties to Stoic and other ancient philosophical movements.
CLASS4637;;;Talmud and the Art of Reading;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;JWST4776;NES4776;RELST4776;;;The Babylonian Talmud has long been viewed as the central text of post-Biblical Judaism.  Yet little is known about who wrote it and when it was written.  Since the Talmud is an extremely difficult text to master, its readership has therefore until recently been limited to few expert traditional scholars.  Over the past fifty or so years, with the advent of translations and study guides, the Talmud has gained increasing popularity. The Talmud has long been viewed as a source for history, law, or moral lessons. But literature interacts with the cultures that produce and read it in far more nuanced and significant ways. In the past century, advances in theories of how and why to read literature have opened up new avenues for understanding what the Talmud says and, more importantly, how it works . This course will examine provocative, bizarre, and salacious Talmud passages through the lens of the evolution of the major theoretical schools of the past century. Each week we will explore a theoretical movement ( e.g. New Criticism, Formalism, Post-Stucturalism, Feminist Criticism, New Historicism , etc .) and apply their reading strategies to close readings of Talmud passages.  We will simultaneously read the work of modern Talmud scholars whose reading practices align with each of these theoretical schools.  All Texts will be read in translation and no previous knowledge of Talmud or Critical Theory is necessary.
CLASS4662;;;Topics in Ancient Philosophy;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(KCM-AS);;;;;;CLASS7173;PHIL4200;PHIL6200;;;Advanced discussion of topics in ancient philosophy.
CLASS4665;;;Augustine;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;PHIL4210;RELST4665;;;Augustine's De Trinitate 10 argues that the mind is an immaterial substance that models in some respects the divine trinity.  This course will study Augustine's conception of the mind, focusing on his arguments for the mind's self-knowledge and their relation to Greek and Latin philosophical antecedents.
CLASS4677;;;Desert Monasticism;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;JWST4557;MEDVL4557;NES4557;RELST4557;;;How and why do landscapes come to inspire the religious imagination? And how do sensory landscapes, more specifically-territories of sight, sound, touch, taste, and smell-inform, inflect, and engage the religious imagination? When and why do religious practices, rituals, traditions, and beliefs inhabit particular landscapes? This seminar treats these questions by focusing on a particular landscape-the "desert," both imagined and real-as it has shaped religious ascetic practice. Biblical notions of howling desert wastelands and subsequent ideas about deserts inhabited by terrifying and grotesque demons; paradise, a garden where angels' wings whir and pure light shines; valleys of rattling dry bones, sinews, and skins that breathe with new life; heavens clanging with the sound of war between seven-headed dragons and angels; demons coming in the forms of roaring lions and hissing serpents-the religious imaginary is shaped in striking ways by sensory landscapes. We will read widely from desert Christian monastic literatures, mostly from late ancient Egypt, to explore both the historical development of monasticism in Christianity and examine why the monastic impulse seems so closely tied to the "desert." In addition to reading saints lives, we will read early monastic rules, the desert fathers, and we will draw from archaeological sources to examine the varieties of ascetic practices in the deserts of late ancient Egypt, Gaza, Sinai, Palestine, and Syria. Throughout the course we will explore ancient and modern ideas about "wilderness" and we will explore parallels between ancient Near Eastern literatures and their nineteenth- and twentieth-century parallels in the American frontier and environmental literatures.

Likewise, the mockery or destruction of these monuments is seen as a potent act of political resistance. These phenomena, together with the related concept of "propaganda," have exerted a strong influence on the interpretation of pre-modern ruler portraits. This course will encourage students to think critically about visual cultures of political rule and to develop an account of the distinctions between ancient, medieval, and modern modalities of ruler portraiture and its reception. Our primary case studies will be the late Roman and Soviet states, with ample comparative material drawn from other polities.

What role has archaeology played in the making of "the East"? And how has material culture been implicated in the discourses that conjure the East into existence? This course probes the archaeology of Orientalism in two respects. Most immediately, it examines the attitudes that have shaped archaeologies of the Near East from the discipline's imperialist beginnings to the present, considering several key tropes of the field (from "civilization" to "oriental despotism" and beyond). In another sense, our concern is the materiality of Orientalism, or the work of things in enabling various dispositions toward the Near East. We also consider Orientalism's antipode, nationalism, examining some of the region's indigenous archaeological approaches and the politics of archaeology today.
CLASS4761;;;Archaeology of Violence in the Ancient Mediterranean: Interpersonal to Interstate;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;Prerequisite: some background in Classics, archaeology, or related disciplines is recommended, but not required.;;;ARKEO4761;;;Students will develop a knowledge of current methods and techniques used to identify violence in the archaeological record. We will study practices from animal sacrifice to the destruction of cities.
CLASS4999;;;Transformations of Sense and Early Modern Thought;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;COML4028;ENGL4999;SHUM4999;;;This seminar investigates concepts of sensation in classical and early modern literature and philosophy, with a particular focus on 16th and 17th century writers. On the one hand, changing ideas of sensation may reflect significant shifts in western histories of physiology and selfhood, and the seminar will attend to these familiar themes. But on the other hand, the topic of sensation suggests ways of reading classical and early modern literature as transhistorical works of art, following Deleuze and Guattari's claim that "Art thinks no less than philosophy, but it thinks through affects and percepts" that form "compounds of sensations." We'll focus on the interweaving of sensation with physiology and environment, through attention to Metamorphosis, Humoral Embodiment, and Darkness. Readings include Aristotle, Ovid, Seneca, Shakespeare, Spenser, Milton, Hobbes, Descartes, Spinoza, Deleuze &amp; Guattari, Foucault, Heidegger, and Cassirer.

CLASS7741;;;Methods and Approaches in Current Archaeology;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;ARKEO7741;;;This seminar course aims to provide students with a review of, and encounter with, a key selection of the main methods and techniques used in current archaeological work, and to develop an understanding of the current practice of archaeology. Topics included are: (i) methods and practice in field archaeology (prospection, archaeological excavation and stratigraphy, survey archaeology and landscape), (ii) investigation of the climate and environmental context of the past, (iii) relative and absolute dating methods in archaeology, (iv) artifact analysis in archaeology (ceramics, stone, metals, etc.) and the role of the object in the discipline, and (v) approaches and issues in the analysis and interpretation of archaeological evidence (what questions to ask, and how to ask them).
CLASS7746;;;Greek and Roman Art and Archaeology;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;ARKEO4233;ARKEO6233;ARTH4233;ARTH6233;CLASS4746;;;Topic for fall 2014: Reproducing Greek and Roman Art Since its inception in classical antiquity the creation of art has been intricately linked to practices of copying and reproduction. This class will investigate the question from different angles, a historical, a theoretical and a practical one. The historical approach focuses on what has been called the invention of art history in connection with various techniques of replication, reproduction, imitation and appropriation. The theoretical approach will discuss notions of "original" and "copy", "authenticity" as well as the "simulacrum" within and beyond an ancient context. Finally, the practical component will entail the documentation for a database (photography, archival work, scholarly research, bibliography) and restoration of some of Cornell's plaster casts. This collection, assembled in the 19th century explicitly for an academic context and once among the largest of its kind in the United States, is today in very bad condition. The seminar is one step among many of a recently initiated research project to rescue and reappraise this precious resource.

COML2000;;;Introduction to Visual Studies;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;AMST2000;ARTH2000;VISST2000;;;Provides a broad introduction of modes of vision and the historical impact of visual images, visual structures, and visual space on culture, communication, and politics. The question of "how we see" is discussed in terms of (1) procedures of sight (from optical machines to the psychology of vision and the philosophy of aesthetics); (2) spaces of vision (from landscapes to maps to cities); (3) objects of vision (from sacred sites to illuminated books to digital art); and (4) performances of vision (race, sexualities, ethnicities, cultures). Of importance to the course is the practical and conceptual relation of 20th-century visual technologies (photography, cinema, video, and computing) to their historical corollaries in the arts. The course draws on the visual traditions of both Western and non-Western societies and study texts that have defined the premises and analytic vocabularies of the visual. Through viewings, screenings, collaborative writing, and art projects, students develop the critical skills necessary to appreciate how the approaches that define visual studies complicate traditional models of defining and analyzing art objects. Guest lecturers occasionally address the class. Requirements: two objective midterm exams; occasional listserve postings; two five-page papers.
COML2006;;;Punk Culture: The Aesthetics and Politics of Refusal;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;AMST2006;ENGL2006;MUSIC2006;;;Punk Culture-comprised of music, fashion, literature, and visual arts-represents a complex critical stance of resistance and refusal that coalesced at a particular historical moment in the mid-1970s, and continues to be invoked, revived, and revised. In this course we will explore punk's origins in New York and London, U.S. punk's regional differences (the New York scene's connection to the art and literary worlds, Southern California's skate and surf culture, etc.), its key movements (hardcore, straight edge, riot grrrl, crust, queercore), its race, class and gender relations, and its ongoing influence on global youth culture. We will read, listen, and examine a variety of visual media to analyze how punk draws from and alters previous aesthetic and political movements.
COML2020;;;Great Books;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;;;;This course traces storytelling as it has developed through interaction with a variety of technology, from the Renaissance printing press to today's social media. Through readings of Rabelais, Cervantes, M. Shelley, Faulkner, Sebald and Piglia and others we will examine how literature has helped forge our understanding and construction of the tools we use to organize, structure and otherwise change the world.
COML2021;;;Humans and Climate Change;;;3;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;EAS2021;;;This course explores the human dimension of climate change, arguably the most significant crisis ever to confront humanity. Of course, changes in the climate are natural, but it is almost universally knowledged that humans have contributed to an unprecedented speeding up of the processes with potentially cataclysmic effects. Drawing on disciplines including cultural studies, history, economics, climate science, philosophy, literary criticism, anthropology, political/labor theory, and sociology the first half of the course asks the question "What did humans do to cause climate change?" and the second half of the course asks "what can humans do to mitigate and adapt to climate change?" A course packet of readings will include works on climate and industrial history, policy-making, biodiversity, ethics, technology, agriculture, design and environmental justice. Students will also be required to watch several films and read several literary texts. In addition to short essays and prelims, students will work together in small groups to produce an interdisciplinary project responding to climate change.
COML2030;;;Introduction to Comparative Literature;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;;;;What is Comparative Literature? In this course, we will look at the various answers that this question has elicited. We will learn about the evolution of the discipline by looking at an assortment of literary texts across national, linguistic and historical boundaries along with a wide array of theoretical works. Comparative Literature, however, is not just an academic field of study but first and foremost a practice. We will develop analytical tools to interpret and compare literary texts and artistic media that engage with sounds and images (photography, cinema, digital art). Mapping a wide-ranking set of trajectories, we will explore the far-reaching implications of our new globalized world through the prism of its literatures. Students will emerge from the seminar with an enhanced awareness of the global literary scene and with the ability to read critically and write with clarity. The course will acquaint students with the breadth and depth of the field, with authors including Plato, Jonathan Swift, Heinrich von Kleist, Edgar Allan Poe, Ferdinand de Saussure, Franz Kafka, Gertrude Stein, Jorge Luis Borges, Lu Xun, Marguerite Yourcenar, Roland Barthes, Aime Cesaire, Toni Morrison, Kazuo Ishiguro, Arundhati Roy.
COML2035;;;Science Fiction;;;4;;;Fall, summer.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ENGL2035;STS2131;;;Science fiction, as Fredric Jameson put it, is "the only kind of literature that can reach back and colonize reality." Today more than ever, when science and technology have penetrated everyday life in ways that would have seemed impossible only a few decades ago, it has become apparent that science fiction is not merely a literary genre but a whole way of being, thinking, and acting in the modern world. The course explores classic and contemporary science fiction from Frankenstein to The Hunger Games alongside a rich array of fiction, films, and new media from Europe, Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Our discussions will position these works vis-a-vis seminal thinkers, ranging from Plato to Descartes and Donna Haraway to Paul Crutzen, who ask the same questions as science fiction does about ourselves, our world, and our future.
COML2200;;;Thinking Surrealisms;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;ARTH2019;VISST2190;;;Borrowing its title from a formulation of Marxist philosopher Ernst Bloch, and beginning from the "forays of demoralization" instigated by the Dadas, who bequeathed to surrealism the precious gift of unreconciliation to the given, this course ranges over several surrealist moments: the inception of surrealist precept and practice in Paris in the mid-1920s;  the explicitly anti-fascist political phase of the 1930s and 40s; the supplementation of Parisian surrealism by Caribbean, Mexican, African American, Quebecois, and Mauritian writers and artists; the reflections of and on surrealism by Bloch, Walter Benjamin, and Theodor W. Adorno; the relations of surrealism to the Situationist International.  Throughout, the course will ask what the proliferation of "thinking surrealisms" meant to the culture and politics of modernity.  All readings in English.
COML2230;;;The Comic Theatre;;;3;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;CLASS2651;PMA2635;;;The origins of comic drama in ancient Greece and Rome, and its subsequent incarnations especially in the Italian renaissance (Commedia erudita and Commedia dell'arte), Elizabethan England, 17th-century France, the English Restoration, and Hollywood in the thirties and forties. Chief topics will be the growth of the comic theatrical tradition and conventions; techniques and themes of comic plots (trickster, parody, farce, caricature); and the role of comedy in society.
COML2580;;;Imagining the Holocaust;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;ENGL2580;JWST2580;;;What is the role of the literary imagination in keeping the memory of the Holocaust alive for our culture? Within the historical context and raising ethical issues, we shall examine major and widely read Holocaust narratives that have shaped the way we understand and respond to the Holocaust. We shall begin with first-person reminiscences---Wiesel's Night, Levi's Survival at Auschwitz, and The Diary of Anne Frank---before turning to realistic fictions such as Kineally's Schindler's List (and Spielberg's film), Kertesz's Fateless, Kosinski's The Painted Bird, and Ozick's "The Shawl." We shall also read the mythopoeic vision of Schwarz-Bart's The Last of the Just, the illuminating distortions of Epstein's King of the Jews, the Kafkaesque parable of Appelfeld's Badenheim 1939, and the fantastic cartoons of Spiegelman's Maus books.
COML2634;;;Jews and the Classical Age of Islam;;;3;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;CLASS2634;JWST2634;NES2634;RELST2634;;;This course examines the cultural and historical interaction of Muslims and Jews from the emergence of Islam in the seventh century through the classical age of Islam down to the turn of the thirteenth century. The intersection of the two cultures (scriptural, spiritual, intellectual, literary, communal, and interpersonal) and members of their respective religious communities will be studied through readings of primary texts (in translation). The course will conclude with some brief reflections on historical memory and the modern and contemporary significance of the two religious communities' interactions during the classical age of Islam.
COML2755;;;Heroines, ArchVillians and AntiHeroes;;;3;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;NES2788;;;What makes a heroine heroic?  What makes a villain dastardly?  In what ways do they differ?  In what ways are they similar?  Are the values that attach to heroism and villainy uniform across cultures?  What roles do might, ruse, and attractiveness play?  What about Good and Evil, 'right' and 'wrong,' honor and treachery?  What makes a superhero, an antihero, an archvillain?  In this course, we will attempt to answer these and other questions together, by reading and analyzing stories and accounts-and by watching films-from Near Eastern and Western literary traditions, including:  The Legend of Sohrab and Rostam, Measure for Measure, The Watchmen, The Stranger, Prince of Persia, the Mahabharat, Alif the Unseen.  All material in English translation.
COML2760;;;Desire;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;ENGL2760;FGSS2760;LGBT2760;PMA2680;;;"Language is a skin," the critic Roland Barthes once wrote: "I rub my language against the other. It is as if I had words instead of fingers, or fingers at the tip of my words. My language trembles with desire." Sexual desire has a history, even a literary history, which we will examine through an introductory survey of European dramatic literature from Plato and Aristophanes to Jean Genet and Caryl Churchill, as well as a survey of classic readings in Western sexual theory from the Ancient Greeks through Freud and Foucault to contemporary feminism and queer theory. Topics for discussion will include Greek pederasty, Christian mysticism, hysteria, sadomasochism, pornography, cybersex, and other performative pleasures.
COML3010;;;Hispanic Theatre Production;;;1-3;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;LATA3010;LSP3010;;;Students develop a specific dramatic text for full-scale production. The course involves selection of an appropriate text, close analysis of the literary aspects of the play, and group evaluation of its representational value and effectiveness. All students in the course are involved in some aspects of production of the play, and write a final paper as a course requirement. Credit is variable depending upon the student's role in play production: a minimum of 50 hours of work is required for 1 credit; a maximum of 3 credits are awarded for 100 hours or more of work.
COML3021;;;Literary Theory on the Edge;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;ENGL3021;;;This course introduces the most exciting and cutting-edge theoretical advances of the 20th and 21st centuries. Taught by two Cornell professors active in the field, along with occasional invited guests, lectures will cover such movements as structuralism, deconstruction, trauma theory, biopolitics, human-animal studies and post-human studies. The specificity of the literary and the enigma of language in all its forms will remain a central focus in the course. Students will have the unique opportunity to develop a theory symposium. Course open to all levels; no previous knowledge of theory required.
COML3115;;;Video and New Media: Art, Theory, Politics;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;ENGL3115;PMA3515;VISST3115;;;The course will offer an overview of video art, alternative documentary video, and digital installation and networked art. It will analyze four phases of video and new media: (1) the development of video from its earliest turn away from television; (2) video's relation to art and installation; (3) video's migration into digital art; (4) the relation of video and new media to visual theory and social movements. Screenings will include early political and feminist video (Ant Farm, Rosler, Paper Tiger TV, Jones), conceptual video of the '80s and '90s (Vasulka, Lucier, Viola, Hill), gay and multicultural video of the '90s (Muntadas, Riggs, Piper, Fung, Parmar), networked and activist new media of the 21st century (Critical Art Ensemble, Electronic Disturbance Theater, SubRosa, Preemptive Media). Secondary theoretical readings on postmodernism, video theory, multicultural theory, and digital culture will provide students with a cultural and political context for the discussion of video and new media style, dissemination, and reception.
COML3260;;;Christianity and Judaism;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;RELST3260;;;Study of the New Testament as a product of the first-century Palestinian and Hellenistic Judaism. Other text (also in translation): The Passover Haggadah.
COML3280;;;Literature of the Old Testament;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;RELST3280;;;Analysis of small sections of well-known material for in-depth discussion.
COML3300;;;Political Theory and Cinema;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;GERST3550;GOVT3705;PMA3490;;;An introduction (without prerequisites) to fundamental problems of current political theory, filmmaking, and film analysis, along with their interrelationship.  Particular emphasis on comparing and contrasting European and alternative cinema with Hollywood in terms of post-Marxist, psychoanalytic, postmodernist, and postcolonial types of interpretation.  Filmmakers/theorists might include: David Cronenberg, Michael Curtiz, Kathryn Bigelow, Gilles Deleuze, Rainer Fassbinder, John Ford, Jean-Luc Godard, Marleen Gorris, Werner Herzog, Alfred Hitchcock, Allen &amp; Albert Hughes, Stanley Kubrick, Fredric Jameson, Chris Marker, Pier-Paolo Pasolini, Gillo Pontecorvo, Robert Ray, Martin Scorsese, Ridley Scott, Oliver Stone, George Romero, Steven Shaviro, Kidlat Tahimik, Maurizio Viano, Slavoj Zizek.  Although this is a lecture course, there will be ample time for class discussions.
COML3440;;;The Tragic Theatre;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;CLASS3645;PMA3724;;;Tragedy and its audiences from ancient Greece to modern theater and film. Topics: origins of theatrical conventions; Shakespeare and Seneca; tragedy in modern theater and film. Works studied will include: Aeschylus' Agamemnon; Sophocles' Oedipus Tyrannus, Philoctetes; Euripides' Alcestis, Helen, Iphigeneia in Aulis, Orestes; Seneca's Thyestes, Trojan Women; Shakespeare's Julius Caesar, Titus Andronicus, Othello; Strindberg's The Father; Durrenmatt's The Visit; Bergman's Seventh Seal; Cacoyannis' Iphigeneia.
COML3475;;;Global Shakespeare;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ENGL3475;PMA3775;;;From Goethe to Aime Cesaire, Orson Welles to Akira Kurosawa, Agha Hashar Kashmiri to Ariane Mnouchkine, writers, artists, actors, and directors around the world have drawn from Shakespeare's works in order to fashion their own.  We will take a global journey from the Renaissance to the present day to discover both Shakespeare's creations and those he inspired.  This course may feature guest speakers, performances, and/or screenings, and specific works may vary from year to year.
COML3531;;;Literature and Moral Complexity;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;FREN3490;ITAL3490;ROMS3490;;;In this course, we will ask how literature helps us to formulate ethical questions, i.e., question for which there is no single, objectively correct answer.  Why literature as opposed to philosophy or history?  Numerous aspects of literture make it ideal for taking on complex ethical questions.  Literture can be used to persuade or even manipulate; it appeals to our emotions as well as our reason, and may even call into question the neat division between the two; it forges sympathies that tie us as readers to characters and narrators, even as we suspect their motives.  For most of our time together, we will focus on great writers and storytellers of early modern Europe (e.g., Boccaccio, Machiavelli, Montaigne, Marguerite de Navarre, Bandello), but we will also explore how ethical questions posed by these early modern writers continue to surface in the work of an author like Barbey D'Aurevilly and in a contemporary movie such as Stephen Spielberg's Lincoln. If there is student interest, we will offer discussion sections in French and Italian.
COML3542;;;Homo Oeconomicus;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;GERST3610;GOVT3606;;;This course examines the economic forces at work in defining and configuring the modern subject, from Adam Smith through Marx and Nietzsche, Simmel and Weber, up to the current neoliberal subject.  The course will investigate figures (as both tropes and subjects) of the human conceived according to three economic paradigms: exchange, debt, and interest. The course will focus on both literary and theoretical sources, including examinations of guiding metaphors (the invisible hand, Schuld as both debt and guilt); the intersection of religious and secular economies; pacts with the devil; economies of salvation/redemption; figures of money/value.
COML3550;;;Decadence;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;ENGL3550;FGSS3550;LGBT3550;;;"My existence is a scandal," Oscar Wilde once wrote, summing up in an epigram the effect of his carefully cultivated style of perversity and paradox. Through their celebration of "art for art's sake" and all that was considered artificial, unnatural, or obscene, the Decadent writers of the late-nineteenth century sought to free the pleasures of beauty, spirituality, and sexual desire from their more conventional ethical moorings. We will focus on the literature of the period, including works by Charles Baudelaire, Edgar Allan Poe, A. C. Swinburne, and especially Oscar Wilde, and we will also consider related developments in aesthetic philosophy, painting, music, theater, architecture, and design.
COML3566;;;Aesthetics and Economics;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;Two models have dominated Western literary aesthetics, one based on Platonic inspiration and another based on Aristotelian craftsmanship and skill. Each has ramifying economic implications, the first based on the value or worth of a divinely endowed talent, the second on practice and hard work. This course will explore how these coordinates relate and diverge in texts by Homer, Virgil, Dante, Rabelais, Diderot, Nietzsche, Dostoyevsky, and Joyce.
COML3580;;;Imaginative Arts of Migration;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;AMST3581;GERST3581;PMA3481;VISST3581;;;What role should imaginative arts play in debates about transnational migration, one of the principal factors re-shaping community and communication today?  Focusing on literature and film from the late 20th and early 21st centuries, with primary examples drawn from Germany, France and the United States-in relation to Turkey, Hungary, Tunisia, Iran, Nigeria, China, Mexico, and Japan-this course explores how creative arts rework the fabric of social life affected by migration.  Seminar-style discussion of assigned readings and viewings, with occasional lectures on other arts and regions.  Thematic units organized around key concepts such as borders and movement, ethnoscapes and citizenship, reading and viewing, labor and leisure, cityscapes and place-making, mediascapes and personhood, lawfulness and illegality, language and speech, art and perception.
COML3620;;;Culture of the Later Renaissance;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ARTH3420;FREN3620;RELST3620;ROMS3620;;;This course explores networks of culture and power that develop over the course of the sixteenth century, from the beginning of the Reformation to the Wars of Religion that swept through the continent.  We will examine this period through the lenses of several disciplines: history, history of science, art history, literature, music.  Guest lecturers will include professors from all of these fields, and authors and artists to be studied will include: Luther, Marguerite de Navarre, Michelangelo, Ambroise Pare, Shakespeare, and Monteverdi.
COML3700;;;Metropolis: Urban Sites in Literature;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;GERST3560;;;An interdisciplinary study of metropolitan life focusing on Berlin and Vienna (1890-1999) and on contemporary global mega-cities as major contexts of artistic modernity and historical change. Topics of investigation include: the city as both the product and source of artistic production; the interrelationship between literary concepts of montage, collage, and their architectural counterparts (Bauhaus et al.); the tension between private and public spaces, and the status of crowds, anonymity, and the flaneur.  We will also analyze the rise of an avant-garde movement in an urban environment. Additional topics: artificial construction of new cities; is the concept "city" still valid? Can we imagine new forms of habitation in our digital world? Focus on short fiction, architectural theory, sites and art history, film, political and literary manifestos. Authors include: Fontane, Broch, Benn, Benjamin, Doblin, Simmel, Krakauer, Johnson, Rilke, Kohlhaas, Vidler, Eisenman, Poe, Blanchot, Certeau, Kafka, Heidegger, Derrida.
COML3723;;;The Arabian Nights: Then and Now;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;COML6723;NES3723;NES6723;;;The medieval Arabic cycle of stories known as The Arabian Nights or The Thousand and One Nights is a classic of world literature. In the first part of the course we will read the Nights and discuss both its dominant themes-deceit, love, sex, revenge, violence, and justice-and its storytelling contexts and antecedents (e.g. the Sanskrit Jataka Tales and the Middle Persian Tales of Bidpai). And in the second part, we will explore the ways in which the Nights' themes and tales have been adapted and appropriated by authors such as Jan Potocki in Polish, Edgar Allan Poe, John Barth and Mary Zimmerman in English, Jorge Luis Borges in Spanish, and Naguib Mahfouz in Arabic itself; and by filmmakers such as Korda, Pasolini and Barron. All material is in English translation.
COML3724;;;Medieval Travel and Exploration;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;JWST3740;MEDVL3740;NES3740;;;In the Middle Ages, people traveled for all many reasons: for adventure, for commerce, on pilgrimage, for conquest.  We will read the accounts of medieval travelers in order better to understand the motives and motivations for travel and for exploration.  Our travelers will include Christian, Jewish, and Muslim merchants, ambassadors, scholars, geographers, explorers, sailors and soldiers.  Readings will include Margery Kempe, Marco Polo, Ibn Battutah, Usama ibn Munqidh, and Benjamin of Tudela.  All material in English translation.
COML3815;;;Reading Nabokov;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;ENGL3790;RUSSL3385;;;This course offers an exciting trip to the intricate world of Nabokov's fiction. After establishing himself in Europe as a distinguished Russian writer, Nabokov, at the outbreak of World War II, came to the United States where he reestablished himself, this time as an American writer of world renown. In our analysis of Nabokov's fictional universe, we shall focus on his Russian corpus of works, from Mary (1926) to The Enchanter (writ. 1939), all in English translation, and then shall examine the two widely read novels which he wrote in English in Ithaca while teaching literature at Cornell: Lolita (1955) and Pnin (1957).
COML3980;;;Theorizing Gender and Race in Asian Histories and Literatures;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ASIAN3388;ASIAN6688;COML6680;FGSS3580;FGSS6580;;;For a long time area studies have overlooked the questions of gender, race/ethnicity, and social class in fields related to East Asia and the trans-Pacific regions. Little attention has been paid to how to conceptualize gender and race/ethnicity; how to analyze the mutual implication of sexism, racism, and class essentialism (some call it "class racism"), and how to understand the relationships of these topics to the broader contexts of colonialism, imperialism, and nationalism. This course is designed to offer a series of discussions about the following problems: (1) the historically specific modes of sexism and racism in social spaces related to Japan and other places in the trans-Pacific; (2) the mutual implication of sexism, racism, and social class in various contexts including those of colonialism, imperialism, and nationalism; (3) the roles of gender, race, and social class in the United States' knowledge production about East Asia in general; and (4) the conceptions of gender and race in the social formations particular to East Asia. The assigned readings include both English and Japanese materials. However, those who register in ASIAN 3388 are exempt from reading the materials in Japanese.
COML3985;;;Literature of Chinese Exile;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;ASIAN3329;ASIAN6639;COML6685;;;Ever since the creation of the concept of a culturally and geographically stable center in China, people have been intentionally excluded from that center. Disgraced officials are sent to far-flung provinces, loyalists to past regimes hide out across China's borders, and dissidents have their entry visas revoked, making it impossible for them to return home. The experiences of these people, and the poems and stories they write, tell us a great deal about what it means and how it feels to be included and excluded. What is the difference between the way China looks from the inside and the way it looks from the outside? Who has the power to decide who gets to live in China, and how and why do they use it? What is the relationship between our identities and our homes? Texts studied will range from 300 BCE to the present; all will be read and discussed in English. 
COML4019;;;Romanticism and the Fate of the Senses;;;4;;;;;;;;;;;;ENGL4491;SHUM4991;STS4981;;;What if, William Blake once asked, every bird that flies "is an immense world of delight, closed by your senses five?" Asking what real and possible worlds our habits of sensory perception exclude, Romantic poets criticized their culture's increasing faith in sense-based, empirical knowledge - knowledge supposedly free from subjective bias, historical circumstance, national prejudice, and political complicity. This seminar will focus on poetry as a form of sensory re-training and on Romantic and post-Romantic claims to a politics of perception. Can artworks access rival science, non-human experience, or otherwise unthinkable histories - or sensually suspend the pressure to do so? Readings from Blake, Keats, Dickinson, Goethe, Locke, Foucault, Latour, Daston, Ranciere, Bourdieu, Williams, de Man, Adorno, Terada, Stewart, and Hartman.
COML4025;;;Sense and Citizenship: Aesthetics in Political Theory;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;GOVT4666;SHUM4990;;;In this seminar, we will inquire into how questions of sensation cross between literature, aesthetics and political theory. Drawing from writings in continental philosophy and phenomenology, the challenge of the class will be to inquire into how sensation in particular broadens notions of citizenship and politics. How do accounts of sensation in political theory reconceive citizenship? What are possible conceptual practices for unraveling normative, colonial, and authoritarian definitions of the political subject? What is the place of sensation in theories of relationality? Students will also be asked to critique the terms under which citizenship is constrained, defined, and regulated. In addition, the course will examine how accounts of sensation delineate traces and figures excluded from the rights conferred by organized polities. In order to account for those excluded from citizenship, the seminar will also consider the role of sight, touch, and imagination in the public realm or, as Hannah Arendt writes, "namely, the faculty of seeing things not only from one's own perspective but from that of all others who are present." Facing the challenge of Arendt's words, the course will reflect on the implications of critique, judgment, and phenomenology for democratic theory in general. Discussions may, for example, seek to uncouple the rhetoric of sovereignty and law from citizenship. Finally, we will ask what a study of sensation provides for redressing and/or accounting for dispossession. As students will be encouraged to integrate their research interests with course reading, topics may include questions of how philosophies of anarchism, civil disobedience, feminism, queer theory, and decolonization broaden ideas of citizenship and political ethics.
COML4026;;;Affective Ecologies;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;ENGL4992;FGSS4992;LGBT4992;SHUM4992;;;This seminar considers the points of intersection between theories of affect, emotion, and sexuality in recent queer and feminist thought, and the set of critical and cultural developments that has come to be called the "nonhuman turn." We will explore contemporary critical attention to the agential, sensory and cognitive capacities of the non-human, considering how this body of work reconfigures the relations between human and nonhuman worlds, and the more flexible and nuanced accounts of "nature" and "environments" that they make possible. At the same time, we will examine how the radically expanded ethos of being-in-common proposed by the non-human turn operates alongside the structures and histories of dehumanization to which and feminist, queer and critical race theory have drawn our attention.
COML4027;;;Archiving Sensation;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;ENGL4994;FGSS4994;LGBT4994;SHUM4994;;;This course will address the 2014-15 Society for Humanities theme of "sensation" through questions of method, focusing in particular on the interdisciplinary challenges of documenting and archiving sensation. Areas of focus will include: theory and practice of the archive from both queer studies and postcolonial studies; intersections of queer theory and affect theory that explore non-normative experiences of sensation, attachment, and intimacy; questions of genre and media, with particular emphasis on the limits and possibilities of "writing" sensation as opposed to representing it in other media, especially experimental and new media practices such as performance and art installation that are more explicitly embodied and/or material.
COML4028;;;Transformations of Sense and Early Modern Thought;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;CLASS4999;ENGL4999;SHUM4999;;;This seminar investigates concepts of sensation in classical and early modern literature and philosophy, with a particular focus on 16th and 17th century writers. On the one hand, changing ideas of sensation may reflect significant shifts in western histories of physiology and selfhood, and the seminar will attend to these familiar themes. But on the other hand, the topic of sensation suggests ways of reading classical and early modern literature as transhistorical works of art, following Deleuze and Guattari's claim that "Art thinks no less than philosophy, but it thinks through affects and percepts" that form "compounds of sensations." We'll focus on the interweaving of sensation with physiology and environment, through attention to Metamorphosis, Humoral Embodiment, and Darkness.

COML4029;;;Feeling in Sound: Touch and the New Musical Body;;;4;;;;;;;;;;;;MUSIC4334;SHUM4998;;;This seminar explores musical, aesthetic, physiological, and mythical  concepts associated with 'touch' in music. Focusing on the relationship between the hand of the musician and musical sound, we will develop an interdisciplinary history of musical touch, especially at the keyboard, from the late 18th century to the present. The four interrelated units focus on: 1) the clavichord and 18th-century concepts of sympathetic vibration; 2) the glass harmonica and physiology of the nervous system; 3) technologies of touch in the 19th century and the disciplining of the hand; and 4) the absent or fantastic touch and its relation to music-making at early 20th-century electronic instruments. We'll study musical, literary and visual texts, including works by C. P. E. Bach, Diderot, Chopin, Schumann, Coleridge, Canetti.  
COML4106;;;Cuba: Literature and Technology;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;;;;How did artists and revolutionary activists take up the media of their day to transform a relatively small island nation into one of the most important and controversial geo-political and cultural hot spots of the 20th century? Analyzing poetic exchanges between Langston Hughes and Nicolas Guillen, theories of guerrilla warfare and "Rebel Radio," novels made from tape recordings, and multi-media films, we will discover how Cuban culture helped define artistic movements across the world. Since many of Cuba's most recognizable figures, such as Jose Marti, spent much of their life outside the island, or, like Ernesto "Che" Guevara, were born elsewhere, we will pay special attention to how technology helps us understand Cuban culture through a transnational or hemispheric framework. All readings will be available in English.
COML4152;;;Dreaming Romanticism;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;ENGL4340;;;The story of the Fall, in John Milton's Paradise Lost, is also a story of dreams. Woven into the epic tale of our first encounter with mortality, Adam's and Eve's trances and dream-life tell their own stories within the grand narrative of human beginnings and raise questions about the nature of poetic language in the face of  life and death. In this course we will trace the perplexing stories of these dreams as they pass from Milton to the Romantic poets, whose poetry can be said to rewrite the peculiar relation between falling and dreaming in a new language of mortality and survival. Authors will include John Milton, William Wordsworth, John Keats, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and Mary Shelley, among others.
COML4165;;;In the Vein of Kafka;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;GERST4165;;;The course begins with the banal observation of Franz Kafka's pervasive influence on many, many later writers. The more important beginning, though, is the understanding that we will be done with Kafka when we are done with bureaucracy, anxiety, exhaustion, family tragicomedy, interpretation, bad air, ambiguous sexuality, religious befuddlement, written and unwritten law, and dreams. Visiting Prague, the Chinese poet Bei Dao relates that his host "took us to Kafka's home beside the square of the Old Town, and pointed out that beneath our feet flowed a huge vein of ore." Reading Kafka and others-Robert Walser, Roberto Arlt, Bruno Schulz, W. G. Sebald, James Kelman, Can Xue, Yoko Tawada-we will mine that ore.
COML4176;;;Still Life: Animals, Technology, Representation;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;ROMS4176;VISST4176;;;The language of "capture" left hunting and military idioms at the end of the 19th century to pervade today's aesthetic, scientific, technological and critical lexicons. This course examines how this leap from the literal to the metaphorical signaled a sea change in the representation of animal life. Looking at an array of literary, artistic and philosophical texts, the course surveys key contributions to thinking through how mechanized technologies of capture (microscopes, photography, cinema, microphones, etc.) informed and transformed our modern conceptions of subjectivity and objectivity, art and non-art, reality and virtuality, life and death, the animal and the human. Authors may include Flaubert, Poe, Welty, Muybridge, Marey, von Uexkull, Benjamin, Deleuze and Guattari, Herzog, Crary, Chow, Ranciere, Haraway.

COML4226;;;Poetry and Mind;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;COML6226;FREN4180;FREN6180;;;This interdisciplinary seminar would like to offer new hypotheses on the ways poetry is understood and experienced by a reader's mind. Our methodology, while non-reductionist, will take into account the current state of cognitive science, and also build on literary theory and philosophy (both "analytic" and "Continental"). Poetry makes use of cognitive structures and paths, of formal repetitions and algorithms-but it also alters and challenges the usual boundaries of thought. Thus, we need to consider both the ordinary and the extraordinary, if we ever want to explain the mental performance of the poetic. A comparative corpus of poems (written in European languages, from Antiquity to the 20th century) will be used throughout the semester. Students from very diverse backgrounds but with an interest in mind and/or language and poetry are welcome.
COML4240;;;The Animal;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ENGL4260;GERST4260;GOVT4279;;;In recent years literary representations and philosophical discussions of the status of the animal vis-a-vis the human have abounded. In this course, we will track the literary phenomenology of animality. In addition we will read philosophical texts that deal with the questions of animal rights and of the metaphysical implications of the "animal." Readings may include, among others, Agamben, Aristotle, Berger, the Bible, Calvino, Coetzee, Darwin, Derrida, Descartes, Donhauser, Gorey, Haraway, Hegel, Heidegger, Herzog, Kafka, Kant, La Mettrie, de Mandeville, Montaigne, Nietzsche, Ozeki, Rilke, Schopenhauer, Singer, Sorabji, Sterchi, Stevens, de Waal, Wittgenstein, Wolfe. A reading knowledge of German and French would be helpful.

COML4290;;;Postcolonial Poetry and the Poetics of Relation;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;COML6350;ENGL4840;ENGL6850;FREN4350;FREN6350;SPAN4350;SPAN6350;;;What kinds of poetry might be usefully characterized as "postcolonial" and what are the stakes of such a designation? How common, variable, translatable are values deemed "postcolonial" for particular poetics across cultures? Is there such a thing as a transnational, transcultural, "Postcolonial Poetics?" What relation(s) do specific textual/poetic features or strategies have to geopolitical, cultural, historical, economic circumstances, and to the condition(s) of what has come to be called the "postcolonial" in particular? With special reference to Edouard Glissant's influential concept of a "poetics of relation," attending as well to our own situatedness as readers-perhaps also, though not necessarily, as writers-of poetry within U.S. (and) academic context(s), this seminar will focus on Caribbean poetry as an especially fruitful site for exploring a diversity of approaches to these and related questions concerning postcoloniality, poetry, community, language, culture, and identity.
COML4339;;;Bodies at the Border;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ASIAN4440;ASIAN6640;COML6339;FGSS4339;FGSS6339;LSP4339;LSP6339;;;Although the wounded, often feminine, body is the most powerful way of imagining border space in both the Indian subcontinent and the Americas, it is seldom coupled with the embodied practices and performances through which borders define everyday life and shape geographical and historical consciousness in the two regions. Drawing upon texts, media, and theory generated from South Asia and Latin America, the course will develop new comparative approaches to the constitutive role that bodies play in creating, maintaining, and imagining borders in the global South.
COML4369;;;Performing Latinidades;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;COML6349;LATA4369;LSP4369;LSP6349;;;This seminar focuses on Latino/a performance within a variety of genres, including drama, film, music, and performance art. The "new global condition" between US Latino/as and Latin America guides our inquiry into local, national and transnational cultural practices. We begin by looking at theoretical work by scholars like Augusto Boal, Bertolt Brecht, and Diana Taylor that help us to better understand the political and social dimensions of performance. Using these frameworks as a point of departure, we examine a range of particular issues that connect diasporic Latino communities around specific cultural practices, including the politics of claiming space, the making of a Latina/o public sphere, transnational and multilingual imaginaries, cultural production and consumption, and alternative/subversive performance practices.  Texts may include works by authors like Carmelita Tropicana, Guillermo Gomez-Pena, Victor Hugo Rascon Banda, Nilo Cruz, Miguel Pinero, and Cristina Michaus.
COML4415;;;The Holocaust in Postwar Culture (1945-1961);;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;COML6415;FREN4415;FREN6415;GERST4411;GERST6411;GOVT4786;GOVT6786;HIST4233;HIST6233;JWST4410;JWST6415;ROMS4410;ROMS6410;;;There is an astonishing discrepancy between our perception of the Holocaust as a central event of the twentieth century and its marginal place in postwar culture.  It is during those years, nevertheless, that the destruction of European Jews aroused an intellectual debate whose philosophical, political, and literary contributions constitute landmarks for contemporary culture and criticism.  The course will explore the reasons for such a discrepancy, reconstructing the steps of the integration of the Holocaust into our historical consciousness.  It will analyze some of the most significant attempts to think such a trauma made by German-Jewish exiles (Arendt, Adorno, Anders), the survivors of the Nazi camps (Amery, Levi, Celan, Antelme), as well as the public intellectuals on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean (Sartre, Bataille, MacDonald, etc).
COML4416;;;Melancholy Left:Marx to Benjamin;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;COML6416;FREN4435;FREN6435;GERST4431;GERST6431;GOVT4696;GOVT6696;HIST4234;HIST6234;ROMS4430;ROMS6430;;;The fall of "real socialism" in 1990 put an end to the experience of twentieth century Marxism.  Its ideas, debates and controversies could be viewed-historicized and revisited-in a different light.  The defeated revolutions of the past century put into question a teleological vision of history, engendering the decline of Marxist historiography and the simultaneous appearance of memory, a previously ignored concept for interpreting the past.  Outlining a symbolic shift from Marx to Benjamin, this change has a melancholic flavor that permeates many expressions of contemporary Left culture (from movies and autobiographies to historical and philosophical essays).  On the other hand, the emergence of Postcolonialism reopened the debate on the Eurocentric roots of Marx's thought and stimulated a new approach to some classical Marxist thinkers and historians such as Gramsci and C.L.R. James.  Taking into account both classical and contemporary texts, the seminar will analyze a reconfigured relationship between history and memory in the Left culture of our post-utopian age.
COML4429;;;Walter Benjamin;;;4;;;;;;;;;;;;ANTHR4413;ANTHR7413;COML6429;GERST4413;GERST6413;JWST4913;JWST7913;NES4913;NES7913;;;This extraordinary figure died in 1941, and his death is emblematic of the intellectual depradations of Nazism. Yet since World War II, his influence, his reputation, and his fascination for scholars in a wide range of cultural and political disciplines has steadily grown. He is seen as a bridging figure between German and Jewish studies, between materialist critique of culture and the submerged yet powerful voice of theology, between literary history and philosophy. We will review Benjamin's life and some of the key disputes over his heritage; read some of the best-known of his essays; and devote significant time to his enigmatic and enormously rich masterwork, the Arcades Project, concluding with consideration of the relevance of Benjamin's insights for cultural and political dilemmas today.
COML4601;;;Writing Muslims: Literature and Film of Muslim Diaspora(s);;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;ENGL4798;NES4707;RELST4707;;;How and where does-indeed, can-one write the story of a diaspora of the Muslim creative and critical imagination? Guided by the critical work of e.g. Hawley, Rushdie, and Subramani, we will read and watch the works of Leila Aboulela, Zulfikar Ghose, Abdulrazak Gurnah, Mohja Kahf, Sorayya Khan, Manzu Islam, Hanif Kureishi, Ian Iqbal Rashid and others. We will critique, evaluate, and enjoy these works through the lens of the diasporic condition, by paying special attention to the effects of displacement and its impact on articulations of faith, history, identity, memory, mythologies, nation(alism), subjugation, the postmodern, and the (post)postcolonial. All readings and films in English.
COML4610;;;Wordsworth and Rousseau;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;ENGL4490;;;This course brings together two great writers of violently different styles, temperaments, and relationships to the French Revolution. Rousseau's writings will be provided in English as well as in French. Wordsworth's poem on "the growth of a poet's mind" will be contrasted with Rousseau's revelatory Confessions: we shall ask about how they reflect guilt, represent happiness, and convey experiences of time and memory. We shall read Rousseau's Discourse on the Origin of Inequality and Wordsworth's manifestos for his poetry. Reading closely some of Wordsworth's poems, we will consider why it makes sense to think of them--like Rousseau's late autobiographical essays--as "reveries of a solitary walker." No previous knowledge of Rousseau, Wordsworth, or Romanticism is required.
COML4700;;;Translation and Cultural Difference;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(KCM-AS);;;;;;ASIAN4481;;;Problems concerning translation are explored. Although there are many different models of translation, we tend to be confined to the unilateral regime of translation, that is, the very narrow and historically specific mode of translation as a transnational transfer of significance between two national or ethnic languages. This course will survey theories of translation with special emphasis on relationships between trans-national translation and transnational transference. Translation establishes a division of two spheres and thereby marks the limit of what can be expressed in one medium. Broadly understood, translation can take place not only between two national languages but also at a variety of boundaries within a single society. We will investigate different economies of translation by which different social and cultural identities are constructed, emphasizing the disappearance of multi-lingualism in the modern nation-state and the mutation of translation tropics which has given rise to new ways of imagining the organicist unity of the society. Historical transformation of translation accompanying the genesis of linguistic and cultural identity will be examined in reference to historical materials. Furthermore, the course will explore the broader conception of translation in terms of which to critically understand communication as the ideology of Capital.
COML4706;;;Between Asia and Latin America: Transpacific Trends in 20th Century Literature, Art, and Theory;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;COML6706;PORT4540;PORT6540;;;Asia and Latin America no longer occupy the disconnected extremes of an imagined map. Nor do they embody the antipodes of East and West, framing Europe and North America as the symbolic centers.  Rather, accelerated by recent geopolitical and global economic shifts, new connections between Asia and Latin America revive the "swarmlike buzz of activity" around and across the perimeter of the Pacific that Claude Levi-Strauss had pitted against "the great Atlantic silence" prior to the European "discovery" of the Americas. This course explores different perspectives on the intercultural study of Asia and Latin America with the aim of rethinking the Transpacific as a method and a lens for comparison that challenges conventional geopolitical models, rather than simply an area or a region. To do so, we will explore multiple meanings, methodologies, and mappings of the Transpacific through a wide range of real and imagined links between Asian and Latin American literature, art, and theory: from diaspora, textual circulation, and cultural exchanges to uneven dialogues, compelling analogies, and conceptual affinities.
COML4773;;;Narrative and Moral Crisis;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;ENGL4773;;;It is often said that literature encourages ethical reflection, and even that it somehow fortifies our disposition to behave in ethical ways. This class will consider a different possibility, that literature, or narrative more generally, often represents or provokes circumstances of extreme moral uncertainty. Such uncertainty, sometimes focused in a moment of decision and sometimes arising from a clash of perspectives, can gather around characters, narrators, authors, and even readers. We will be focusing intensively on a few works of literary and cinematic art, ranging from the Book of Genesis to Ian McEwan's Atonement, in which moral issues emerge with particular urgency and complexity.
COML4782;;;The Transhuman Interface;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;;;;This seminar will explore the human-machine interface by way of the emergent disciplines of social robotics and transhumanism. We will read 17th and 18th century texts on automata and l'homme machine as well as contemporary robotic theory that focuses on haptics, interactivity, and human-robot sexuality. In 2007, South Korea's Ministry of Commerce, Industry, and Energy announced that it would be drawing up a Robot Ethics Charter, a preemptive mandate that would restructure not only the border between machines and human beings, but territorial borders as well. The colonial nomos of the earth required mandates that deemed colonized people as either human, sub-human, or inhuman depending on territorial objectives. We might ask, what kind of territorial objective does the South Korean Robot Ethics Charter anticipate?
COML4783;;;Grammatechnics and the Bioarchive;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;This seminar will explore new forms of biomedia such as transgenic art and tissue culture through the biosemiotic paradigm, which suggests that all life is regulated by "linguistic" principles and that DNA can be understood as a bioarchive or a mnemotechnics of inscription.  Bioarchives such as genetic codes lend themselves to grammatechnical methodologies-i.e. reading according to the materiality of inscription and the letter-because these codes are free from principles of teleology, intentionality, and consciousness: in short, the "natural" signs that constitute genetic codes should be read as purely material positings.  Contemporary literary theory that has focused on the materiality of language may already be ahead of the game: biological life-human or otherwise-is a technics of inscription.
COML4831;;;Reading Joyce's Ulysses;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;ENGL4700;;;A thorough episode-by-episode study of the art and meaning of Joyce's masterwork Ulysses, the most influential book of the twentieth century. We shall place Ulysses in the context of Joyce's canon, Irish culture, and literary modernism. We shall explore the relationship between Ulysses and other experiments in modernism-especially painting and sculpture-and show how Ulysses redefines the concepts of epic, hero, and reader. We shall examine Ulysses as a political novel-specifically, Joyce's response to Yeats and the Celtic Renaissance; Joyce's role in the debate about the direction of Irish politics after Parnell; and Joyce's response to British colonial occupation of Ireland. We shall also consider Ulysses as an urban novel in which Bloom, the marginalized Jew and outsider, is symptomatic of the kind of alienation created by urban culture. No previous experience with Joyce is required.

COML4944;;;Biopolitics;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;COML6944;ROMS4944;ROMS6944;;;This course explores the philosophical concept of biopolitics and its diverse translations and/or adaptations across multiple disciplines and across the globe (Africa, Far East, South East Asia, and the Americas). We will trace the concept of biopolitics and its attendant notions-Biopower, Sovereignty, Governmentality-as they emerge in the work of Michel Foucault and analyze the multiple disciplinary and geographical directions in which they have travelled. Throughout the semester, we shall examine 1. the innovative thinking around biopolitics in the works of Arendt, Esposito, Agamben, Hardt and Negri, 2. the connections and entanglements of the concept with postcolonial theory in Mbembe, Samaddar, Sakai, Mezzadra, 3. the extension and complication of biopolitical logistics over to non-human bodies in Uexkull, Sloterdijk, Wolfe, Shukin. Additionally, we will examine theorizations of new stylistics of power as well as emerging forms of agency and political organizing in the biopolitical sphere. Key terms include race, postcoloniality, animality, capture, embodiment, agency, technology.

As we focus on African artists and theorists, we also read American and European theorists, including but not certainly limited to Giorgio Agamben, Michel Foucault, Roland Barthes, and Joseph Slaughter, detecting the ways in which discourses around bodies in the African context may shape contemporary theories and vice versa.

COML6156;;;Trauma Theory Today;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;ENGL6430;;;This course examines the history, and historicity, of the theory of trauma at crucial moments in the 20th and 21st centuries. We will examine major theoretical texts in relation to their historical contexts and more recent attempts to expand the field in new directions, including terrorism, nuclear threat, ecological catastrophe, neuroscience, legal contexts, political discourse, theological discourse, and non-Western contexts.. Questions will concern the nature of history, event, and testimonial archive as well as the changing question of (the language of) witness in a world in which traumatic repetition is bound up with historical erasure. Guest speakers include Robert Jay Lifton, Shoshana Felman, Elisabeth Weber, Elizabeth Rottenberg, John Zilkosky, Peter Balakian, Carolyn Dean, among others.

With special reference to Edouard Glissant's influential concept of a "poetics of relation," attending as well to our own situatedness as readers-perhaps also, though not necessarily, as writers-of poetry within U.S. (and) academic context(s), this seminar will focus on Caribbean and U.S. poetry as especially fruitful sites for exploring a diversity of approaches to these and related questions concerning postcoloniality, poetry, community, language, culture, and identity.

This course probes the reasons for this historical change. From the arguments of the critics we will derive a catalogue of criteria for a viable aesthetics in order to examine how contemporary aesthetic theory relates to cognitive theories, the historicity of art and taste (including specific practices and institutions), and the emancipatory potentials of ethics and politics. Readings may include Adorno, Berger, de Bolla, Bourdieu, Noel Carroll, Cavell, Danto, Derrida, Dickie, Eagleton, Goodman, Guillory, Gumbrecht, Halsall, Luhmann, Lyotard, de Man, Walter Benn Michaels, Obrist, Ohmann, Scarry, Seel, Shustermann, Barbara Herrnstein Smith, Williams and others.

COML6472;;;The Problem with Rights;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;AMST6472;FGSS6472;GOVT6776;HIST6472;LGBT6472;;;In June 2013, in the space of a week, the Supreme Court ruled on affirmative action, the legacy of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, and the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). While the first two decisions were perceived as a step back in the fight against racial discrimination, the repeal of DOMA was welcomed by mainstream LGBT-rights organizations as a decisive move towards equality. One of the goals of this seminar is to think these rulings together instead of treating them as separate entities. How did the struggle for sexual rights and the promotion of color blindness come to coexist so easily within the law? In order to understand how liberalism has operated historically and theoretically as a crucial site of regulation for sexuality and race, we will read texts from a wide range of contexts and disciplines including political theory, anthropology, literature, philosophy, history, and law. Readings will include "classic" critics of liberalism such as Marx, Nietzsche, Althusser, and Foucault, and contemporary authors such as Wendy Brown, Elizabeth Povinelli, Lisa Duggan, David Eng, Janet Halley, Katherine Franke, and Jasbir Puar, among others.
COML6631;;;Marx and Marxisms;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;GERST6100;GOVT6706;SPAN6100;;;The terms "Marx" and "Marxisms" have meant different things to different people, beginning with Marx himself and continuing in his legacy today.  As obviously, this legacy remains global (Europe, North and Latin America, India and Pakistan, Vietnam, Africa, Near East and Far East)--all still including imagined allies, neutrals, and foes.  This seminar is an approach to this otherwise bewildering complexity: we focus on two things: (1) a possible Marxist (or Communist or Anarchist) theory of all language and any semiotics; alongside (2) its equally possible inter-action with manuals of guerrilla warfare.
COML6680;;;Theorizing Gender and Race in Asian Histories and Literatures;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;Prerequisite: reading knowledge of Japanese.;;;ASIAN3388;ASIAN6688;COML3980;FGSS3580;FGSS6580;;;For a long time area studies have overlooked the questions of gender, race/ethnicity, and social class in fields related to East Asia and the trans-Pacific regions. Little attention has been paid to how to conceptualize gender and race/ethnicity; how to analyze the mutual implication of sexism, racism, and class essentialism (some call it "class racism"), and how to understand the relationships of these topics to the broader contexts of colonialism, imperialism, and nationalism. This course is designed to offer a series of discussions about the following problems: (1) the historically specific modes of sexism and racism in social spaces related to Japan and other places in the trans-Pacific; (2) the mutual implication of sexism, racism, and social class in various contexts including those of colonialism, imperialism, and nationalism; (3) the roles of gender, race, and social class in the United States' knowledge production about East Asia in general; and (4) the conceptions of gender and race in the social formations particular to East Asia. The assigned readings include both English and Japanese materials. However, those who register in ASIAN 3388  are exempt from reading the materials in Japanese.
COML6685;;;Literature of Chinese Exile;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;ASIAN3329;ASIAN6639;COML3985;;;Ever since the creation of the concept of a culturally and geographically stable center in China, people have been intentionally excluded from that center. Disgraced officials are sent to far-flung provinces, loyalists to past regimes hide out across China's borders, and dissidents have their entry visas revoked, making it impossible for them to return home. The experiences of these people, and the poems and stories they write, tell us a great deal about what it means and how it feels to be included and excluded. What is the difference between the way China looks from the inside and the way it looks from the outside? Who has the power to decide who gets to live in China, and how and why do they use it? What is the relationship between our identities and our homes? Texts studied will range from 300 BCE to the present; all will be read and discussed in English.
COML6706;;;Between Asia and Latin America: Transpacific Trends in 20th Century Literature, Art, and Theory;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;COML4706;PORT4540;PORT6540;;;Asia and Latin America no longer occupy the disconnected extremes of an imagined map. Nor do they embody the antipodes of East and West, framing Europe and North America as the symbolic centers. Rather, accelerated by recent geopolitical and global economic shifts, new connections between Asia and Latin America revive the "swarmlike buzz of activity" around and across the perimeter of the Pacific that Claude Levi-Strauss had pitted against "the great Atlantic silence" prior to the European "discovery" of the Americas. This course explores different perspectives on the intercultural study of Asia and Latin America with the aim of rethinking the Transpacific as a method and a lens for comparison that challenges conventional geopolitical models, rather than simply an area or a region. To do so, we will explore multiple meanings, methodologies, and mappings of the Transpacific through a wide range of real and imagined links between Asian and Latin American literature, art, and theory: from diaspora, textual circulation, and cultural exchanges to uneven dialogues, compelling analogies, and conceptual affinities.
COML6723;;;The Arabian Nights: Then and Now;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;COML3723;NES3723;NES6723;;;The medieval Arabic cycle of stories known as The Arabian Nights or The Thousand and One Nights is a classic of world literature. In the first part of the course we will read the Nights and discuss both its dominant themes-deceit, love, sex, revenge, violence, and justice-and its storytelling contexts and antecedents (e.g. the Sanskrit Jataka Tales and the Middle Persian Tales of Bidpai). And in the second part, we will explore the ways in which the Nights' themes and tales have been adapted and appropriated by authors such as Jan Potocki in Polish, Edgar Allan Poe, John Barth and Mary Zimmerman in English, Jorge Luis Borges in Spanish, and Naguib Mahfouz in Arabic itself; and by filmmakers such as Korda, Pasolini and Barron. All material is in English translation.
COML6724;;;The Literature and Film of Muslims and Others in Diaspora;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;NES6707;RELST6707;;;Together we explore how contemporary diasporic Muslim, Latin American, European and Asian writers and filmmakers operate with(in) memory, with the impossible longing to belong, with the loss of 'home' (when 'home' is where they already are?) We will read and plumb Zulfikar Ghose, Abdulrazak Gurnah, Sorayya Khan, Manzu Islam and Hanif Kureishi; and we will watch 'My Beautiful Laundrette,' 'Surviving Sabu' and 'Le Grand voyage'. Participants will be invited to each contribute one primary reading or viewing to the seminar. To sharpen our critical lenses-viz. the diasporic condition, identity, memory, gender and mythology-we will be guided by Ahmed, Erickson, Hawley, Rushdie, and Subramani. Together we will try to understand how the expatriate, the im/migrant, the emigre, writes herself, her world, and her condition. Most material in English.
COML6725;;;Medieval Travel Writing;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;JWST6740;MEDVL6740;NES6740;SPAN6740;;;We will read a selection of medieval travel accounts, paying special attention to the ways in which travelers observed, interacted with, and described the people they encountered and the places they visited.  Material will include:  Buzurg ibn Shahrayar's Wonders of the Indian Ocean, Ibn Fadlan's Mission to the Volga, Evliya Celebi'sBook of Travels, the anonymous Ottoman History of the New World, and European material including Marco Polo, Sir John Mandeville, and Bartolomeo de las Casas.  All material in English and/or Spanish.
COML6782;;;Perversions of the Linguistic Turn: Figure, Fetish, Formalization;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;FREN6280;;;A number of influential thinkers have contested in recent years the so-called "linguistic turn" in twentieth century thought, and in particular the assumption that the "finitude" or decompletion of language dooms to failure any attempt to construct or transmit the objects of thought and experience.  If the "finitist" view is often identified with the structuralism of Jacques Lacan or with Jacques Derrida's influential account of the "supplement" (a tropological understanding of language as founded upon lack and substitution), recent critics of finitude have turned to practices like mathematical formalization (Badiou, Meillassoux) or to such concepts as "desiring machines" (Deleuze and Guattari), the "figural" (Lyotard), the "event" (Badiou), "plasticity" (Malabou) or "ancestrality" (Meillassoux) to elaborate approaches to the construction or transmission of an object that are characterized either as extra-linguistic or as modalities of language not conditioned by lack or substitution, which pretend to "write the real" rather than to re-present it tropologically in the mode of repression or negation.  We will focus our attention on three linguistic modes that purport to straddle the alleged gap between language and its "real": figure, fetish, and formalization.  In addition to the authors mentioned above, readings will include selections from Quintillian,Paul, Auerbach, Foucault, and Perniola, as well as literary works by Sade, Sacher-Masoch, Lautreamont, Mallarme, Gide.
COML6793;;;Theory & Analysis of Narrative;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;ENGL6155;;;Study of short stories and a novel that self-consciously foreground questions of narrative form and technique and the process of reading. Authors to be read include Balzac, Borges, Barth, Calvino, Cortazar, Kafka, and others selected by the students themselves. We will also read theoretical essays on the analysis of narrative by Barthes, Bakhtin, Booth, Genette, Fludernik, Pratt, Altman, Shklovsky, and others, focusing on questions about relations between plot and narrative discourse, the discrimination of narrators, the role of gender, and interpretive frameworks for thinking about narrative. Short exercises, an oral report and a longer paper.
COML6932;;;Digital Discourse: Humanities, Art, Theory, Archive;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;ENGL6965;PMA6965;VISST6965;;;What is the relation of the theory and archival practice of the 'digital turn' to the overall question of the humanities? The course will consider a range of critical pressure points that have been central to the digital humanities and the production of new media art and theory. How have the developments of digital culture and theory impacted the critical commonplaces of archive, analogy, time, sound, motion, network, body, narrative? Does the destabilization of the archive by open source software and accumulative databases alter the conditions of academic research, the space of artistic practice, and the place of ideology critique?  How do recent trends in "media archeology" and "new materiality" correspond to or contrast with the virtuality of "new media" and the theoretical precedents of poststructuralism. In dialogue with critical paradigms that have been fundamental to the discourse of critical theory, from affect and trauma or aesthetics and archive, to colonialism and politics, sexuality and race, we will reflect on the parameters of a deeply significant archeological shift emphasized, if not wholly embodied, by the digital condition.
COML6944;;;Biopolitics;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;COML4944;ROMS4944;ROMS6944;;;This course explores the philosophical concept of biopolitics and its diverse translations and/or adaptations across multiple disciplines and across the globe (Africa, Far East, South East Asia, and the Americas). We will trace the concept of biopolitics and its attendant notions-Biopower, Sovereignty, Governmentality-as they emerge in the work of Michel Foucault and analyze the multiple disciplinary and geographical directions in which they have travelled. Throughout the semester, we shall examine 1. the innovative thinking around biopolitics in the works of Arendt, Esposito, Agamben, Hardt and Negri, 2. the connections and entanglements of the concept with postcolonial theory in Mbembe, Samaddar, Sakai, Mezzadra, 3. the extension and complication of biopolitical logistics over to non-human bodies in Uexkull, Sloterdijk, Wolfe, Shukin. Additionally, we will examine theorizations of new stylistics of power as well as emerging forms of agency and political organizing in the biopolitical sphere. Key terms include race, postcoloniality, animality, capture, embodiment, agency, technology.
COML6945;;;Body Politics in African Literature and Cinema;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;ASRC4995;ASRC6945;COML4945;ENGL4741;FGSS4945;FGSS6945;LGBT4945;LGBT6945;VISST4945;VISST6945;;;The course examines how postcolonial African writers and filmmakers engage with and revise controversial images of bodies and sexuality-genital cursing, same-sex desire, HIV/AIDS, genital surgeries, etc. Our inquiry also surveys African theorists' troubling of problematic tropes and practices such as the conception in 19th-century racist writings of the colonized as embodiment, the pathologization and hypersexualization of colonized bodies, and the precarious and yet empowering nature of the body and sexuality in the postcolonial African experience. As we focus on African artists and theorists, we also read American and European theorists, including but not certainly limited to Giorgio Agamben, Michel Foucault, Roland Barthes, and Joseph Slaughter, detecting the ways in which discourses around bodies in the African context may shape contemporary theories and vice versa.
COML6970;;;Cosmopolitanism;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;ENGL6970;GOVT6779;;;This course will examine cosmopolitanism as a cultural, moral, and political concept both historically, with reference primarily to the eighteenth century, and theoretically, in contemporary debates. The aim will be to elaborate critically the universalist and egalitarian premises of the Enlightenment notion of cosmopolitical subjects and to evaluate what progressive or ideological functions this notion continues to play in discourses on sovereignty, human rights, religious tolerance, and cultural dissemination and aesthetic community. Works by Cicero, Hobbes, Adam Smith, Rousseau, Kant, and Marx will be read with those by Arendt, Balibar, Derrida, Habermas, Honig, and other contemporary theorists.
COML6999;;;Listening and Audio Cultures;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;AMST7320;LSP6320;MUSIC7320;SPAN6320;;;This seminar focuses on the political economy of sound and listening in the configuration of urban space in Latin America and among Latino communities in the U.S. The city will be approached from a multidisciplinary perspective centered on the experience of sound and listening as a critical component in the performance of the social, cultural, political, and ethnic subjectivities and objectivities of the urban.

It focuses on how people manage interactions and identities, develop and maintain relationships, accomplish social goals, create shared meanings, and engage in collaboration and conflict in social media. Emphasis will be placed on how current thinking in relational communication can explain and anticipate interpersonal dynamics on the Internet, but also on how online behaviors may challenge traditional principles of human communication. A major part of the course is a semester-long research project in which students working in small groups design, run, and present their own empirical study of personal relationships and technology.
COMM3450;;;Human-Computer Interaction Design;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(SBA);;;Prerequisite or corequisite: COMM 2450/INFO 2450.;;;INFO3450;;;Gives students insight into the design of computer interfaces and software from the user's point of view.

COMM4560;;;Community Involvement in Decision Making;;;3;;;Fall.;;;(SBA);;;;;;;;;Involving community members is an essential yet challenging part of decision making. Through readings, course activities, and analysis of case studies, this class will examine traditional and contemporary methods of community involvement in a variety of contexts. When evaluating the methods, the class will discuss and define criteria for success.
COMM4580;;;The Science of Social Behavior;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(SBA);;;Prerequisite: At least one statistics course and a major in either Human Development, Psychology, Sociology, or Economics.;;;HD4580;ILRLR4580;SOC4580;;;This is a small capstone seminar for select seniors (and the occasional junior) who are interested in graduate study in scientific disciplines that focus on human behavior and social interaction. The course mirrors HD 2580 "Six Pretty Good Books," an introductory lecture course for entering students and students whose majors are outside the social and behavioral sciences. Both classes (2580 and 4580) will use the same set of readings, but the seminar format is a weekly 90-minute in-depth discussion rather than lecture. Most importantly, unlike 2580, 4580 is not about the books; rather, it is about how to teach the books.  Much of our in-class analysis of the books centers on identifying what are the key contributions to knowledge, as well as important limitations, and how best to communicate these ideas to students with little background in the social sciences. All students are provided the opportunity to lead one or more discussion groups in 2580.  In addition to facilitating metacognitive understanding of the books, the seminar has two additional goals: 1) to provide advanced undergraduates with an opportunity to summon, integrate, and apply insights that they have acquired over the course of their undergraduate education as they analyze arguments from the standpoint of multiple social sciences, and 2) to integrate scholarship across disciplinary lines, a major goal of University Courses.
COMM4660;;;Public Communication of Science and Technology;;;3;;;Spring.;;;(SBA);;;Prerequisite: COMM 2850, or COMM 3020, ENGRC 3500, or permission of instructor.;;;STS4661;;;Explores the structure, meanings, and implications of "public communication of science and technology" (PCST). Examines the contexts in which PCST occurs, looks at motivations and constraints of those involved in producing information about science for nonprofessional audiences, and analyzes the functions of PCST. Ties existing ideas about PCST to general communication research, and leads to developing new knowledge about PCST. Format is primarily seminar/discussion.
COMM4860;;;Risk Communication;;;3;;;Fall.;;;(SBA);;;;;;;;;Every day we face known and unknown risks to our own health and safety and risks to the environment.

This course considers development as an evolving world project and from the perspective of its social and ecological impact: asking questions about costs and benefits of economic growth, about the global context (geo-political, institutional, production, consumption, and discursive relations), and the sustainability of various models. We relate development trends in the South/Third World with those in the North/First World. We also examine shared, global issues, such as the environment, human rights, security, and their condition in different parts of the world. In examining development historically, we encourage students to situate trends shaping the twenty-first century world, and how they can contribute, as global citizens, to the ongoing debate about how to reformulate development as an inclusive an empowering social process. This course combines Lectures with discussion, and uses films and section discussions to promote reflection on diversity of cultures and understandings of human development. It also includes a special component (access by instructor permission), in conjunction with Cornell's Writing in the Majors Program.

We address questions of the following kind:  What are the major forms of stratification in human history?  Are inequality and poverty inevitable?  How many social classes are there in advanced industrialism societies?  Is there a "ruling class?"  Are lifestyles, attitudes, and personalities shaped fundamentally by class membership?  Can individuals born into poverty readily escape their class origins and move upward in the class structure?  Are social contacts and "luck" important forces in matching individuals to jobs and class positions?  What types of social processes serve to maintain and alter racial, ethnic, and gender discrimination in labor markets?  Is there an "underclass?"  These and other questions are addressed in light of classical and contemporary theory and research.

DSOC3311;;;Environmental Governance;;;3;;;Fall.;;;(SBA);;;;;;BSOC3311;DSOC6320;NTRES3311;NTRES6310;STS3311;;;Environmental governance is defined as the assemblage of institutions that regulate society-nature interactions and shape environmental outcomes across a range of spatial and temporal scales.  Institutions, broadly defined, are mechanisms of social coordination including laws (formal) and social norms (informal) that guide the behavior of individuals.  Participants in the course will explore the roles of governments, markets, and collective action in environmental management and mismanagement. We will emphasize interactions among leading environmental policy strategies: public regulation, market-based incentives, and community-based resource management. The course is focused around a set of analytic perspectives.  These theoretical frameworks allow us to synthesize empirical observations and material changes in ways that inform our understanding of contemporary evolution of environmental policy and management.
DSOC3400;;;Agriculture, Food, Sustainability and Social Justice;;;3;;;Fall.;;;(SBA) (KCM);;;;;;;;;How is our food produced: where, by whom and under what conditions? What are the major trends and drivers of the agriculture and food system? How has our agriculture and food system changed over time? What are some of the environmental, social, nutritional and health implications of our food system? In this course we will use a sociological perspective to examine the social, political, economic and environmental aspects of agriculture and food. We will consider the historical background to our food and agricultural system, and will look at different agriculture and food issues in the Global North and South. We will also examine examples of alternative agriculture and food approaches and concepts, such as food sovereignty, agroecology, food justice, fair trade and community-supported agriculture, all of which attempt to support more sustainable, socially equitable agriculture and food systems.Engaged, critical learning is encouraged, including regular field trips for hands-on learning, guest speakers and films as well as discussions and lecture-based classes.
DSOC3700;;;Comparative Social Inequalities;;;3;;;Spring.;;;(SBA) (D);;;Prerequisite: introductory social science course.;;;SOC3710;;;The course begins by identifying the origins of social inequality within the transition to agricultural society. Second, the course describes how inequality is reconfigured by the transition from agriculture to industry. Contemporary social science perspectives on industrial society are then entertained, and it is acknowledged that there is a lack of consensus about the portent of rising inequality that began during the late 20th Century. To frame this question, the course embarks upon a comparative historical analysis of industrialization to determine where society may be heading. Because the trend in inequality suggests that a new social order is in the making, the course ultimately asks, "What might be contours of the new social order?"
DSOC4080;;;Demographic Techniques II;;;3;;;Spring.;;;;;;Prerequisite: PAM 2030.;;;DSOC6080;PAM4080;PAM6060;;;This is the second course in the demographic techniques sequence. It has two foci.

DSOC6001;;;The Empirics of Development and Social Change;;;3;;;Spring.;;;(SBA);;;;;;;;;The purpose of this course is to review, critically discuss, and apply several analytical approaches for measuring and explaining societal change. It is designed to serve as a complement to theories of development and social change. It reviews how researchers can empirically examine the competing claims from contending theories. More broadly, the course examines the empirical record on global change in such development outcomes as inequality, education, food sufficiency, health, women's status, and the reasons why these outcomes differ across societies and communities. In reviewing this empirical record, we draw from several methodological approaches, both quantitative and qualitative, including case studies, evaluative studies, cross-country or cross community analyses, historical analyses, analyses of individual and household survey data. The insights of weaknesses of these various approaches will be discussed. The course will also introduce a set of decomposition methods that are fundamentally useful to study social change by aggregating micro-level evidence on individual behavior and change therein.

DSOC7001;;;Historical Sociology of Modernity;;;3;;;Spring.;;;(KCM) (HA);;;;;;;;;The idea of modernity, as a postulated relationship between social change and institutional form, and as a conceptual schema for making sense of large-scale social transformations, constitutes the primary object of inquiry of classical social theory. Conceived as a uniquely European phenomenon that spread to the rest of the world through the impact of colonial empires and the world market, it also supplies the normative frameworks for many contemporary theories of development. This conception of modernity, and the meta-theories that legitimate it, has been the subject of increasingly heated scholarly controversy. In this course, we explore some of the critical debates that animate this field of historical sociology, alternating our focus between contrasting studies of the institutional dynamics of modernity and critical reflections on how these studies are shaped by the adoption of particular epistemologies.
DSOC7500;;;Food, Ecology, and Agrarian Change;;;3;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;This seminar is concerned with the sociology of agri-food systems and their ecological relations. Modernization narratives, in casting agriculture as an original baseline of human development, have (inadvertently or not) consigned agriculture, and food, to the margins of social thought and analysis. The current crisis of the global food economy has focused attention and public discourse on agriculture, and its increasingly evident ecological implications. Pressing ecological questions, in addition to the latest food crisis, are forcing a new look at the agri-food system and its social and environmental functions. This seminar is designed to introduce students to analytical approaches and contemporary issues and processes concerning food, ecology and agrarian change.

They include: 1) the definition of the reference group; 2) the possible presence of unobserved attributes that may generate a problem of confounding variables (spurious spatial correlation); and 3) simultaneity in agents' behavior that may hinder identification of exogenous effects, i.e., influence of agents' attributes) from endogenous effects, i.e., influence of agents' outcomes. This short course focuses on identification issues.

EDUC5020;;;Education and Development in Africa;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;ASRC6600;;;In the 1950s and 1960s, the human capital theory that emphasizes the importance of formal education for achievement of full productive potential of individuals and economic growth and development of countries enjoyed a renewed popularity. African countries promoted educational expansion with the expectation that it would lead to socio-economic development. The initial euphoria, however, was followed by skepticism and then disillusion.  Education, as it was being organized, delivered, received, and utilized, began to be perceived even as a hindrance to development. The course examines the relationship between formal education and individual and national development. Different paradigms of development, including modernization and dependency theories, and Third World Forum, are discussed with an emphasis on the perceived and actual roles of education in individual and national development. The issues to be discussed include education and schooling, the role of primary, secondary, and higher education in development, the problems of employment, language, equity in access and results with a focus on gender, race, and social class. Case studies, including selected countries of the different African sub-regions, will be used for illustration.

From Gulliver's Travels to "The Tyger," from Jane Austen to "Jabberwocky:" your favorite authors writing today know these classics. This course surveys 250 years of English poetry and prose, from the barbed wit of Swift and Pope and the beguiling wanderings of the Romantics poets, to the myths retold by Victorian writers and the rumblings of war in Modernism. Lectures and weekly discussion sections teach close reading and other skills needed for in-depth literary study. Authors may include Alexander Pope, William Blake, John Keats, Robert Browning, Christina Rossetti, W.B. Yeats, Virginia Woolf, and others. No previous study of this literature is assumed.
ENGL2030;;;Introduction to American Literatures: Beginnings to the Civil War;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;AMST2030;;;This course begins with a look at the philosophies of the first Americans, Native Americans, using the example of the Navajo creation narratives, and then proceeds to read European, African American, and other Native texts in order to understand what forces shaped the formation of the United States and pulled it apart by the time of the Civil War. We will be particularly interested in the forces of colonialism, capitalism, and democracy, through the readings of such documents as the journals of Christopher Columbus; the Indian captivity narratives of Mary Rowlandson and Mary Jemison; the political writings of Tom Paine, James Madison, Thomas Jefferson, and Henry David Thoreau; narratives of African American resistance by David Walker, Harriet Jacobs, and Frederick Douglass; the Pequot William Apess's writings for the rights of American Indians; and the fiction of Harriet Beecher Stowe and Herman Melville.
ENGL2035;;;Science Fiction;;;4;;;Fall, summer.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;COML2035;STS2131;;;Science fiction, as Fredric Jameson put it, is "the only kind of literature that can reach back and colonize reality." Today more than ever, when science and technology have penetrated everyday life in ways that would have seemed impossible only a few decades ago, it has become apparent that science fiction is not merely a literary genre but a whole way of being, thinking, and acting in the modern world. The course explores classic and contemporary science fiction from Frankenstein to The Hunger Games alongside a rich array of fiction, films, and new media from Europe, Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Our discussions will position these works vis-a-vis seminal thinkers, ranging from Plato to Descartes and Donna Haraway to Paul Crutzen, who ask the same questions as science fiction does about ourselves, our world, and our future.
ENGL2040;;;Introduction to American Literature: Civil War to the Present;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;AMST2040;;;This course will introduce students to American literature from the Civil War to the present. We will consider a wide range of authors and literary movements while paying close attention to radical shifts in American culture in the past century and a half. We will ask: What traditions do American authors inherit and what new ones do they invent? How does this writing engage central issues of modern American culture such as race, immigration, class mobility, and technology? The class will examine a variety of genres including poetry, novels, manifestos, and drama. Authors include Mark Twain, Kate Chopin, T.S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, William Faulkner, Felipe Alfau, Langston Hughes, Allen Ginsberg, Thomas Pynchon, Toni Morrison, and others.

We read ten plays covering the length of Shakespeare's career: comedies, history plays, tragedies, and romances, including The Merchant of Venice, Twelfth Night, The Tempest, Othello, King Lear, Richard II, Henry IV Part One, and Henry V. Our study will include attention to dramatic forms, Shakespeare's themes, and social and historical contexts, including early modern English theater history. The course combines lectures and hands-on work in weekly discussions focused on performance, close reading, and questions raised by the plays. We will also view some film adaptations of Shakespeare.
ENGL2350;;;Literature and Medicine;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;BSOC2350;FGSS2350;LGBT2350;;;How does literary language depict the experience of physical suffering? Can a poem or a novel palliate pain, illness, even the possibility of death? From darkly comic narratives of black plague and accounts of early modern melancholy to twentieth century critiques of the mental institution and depictions of the AIDS crisis, this course examines literature centered on medical practices from the early modern period through the twentieth century. Why have medical practices changed, and how do writers address their political, social, and ideological implications? Readings will include a broad range of genres, including poetry (Coleridge, Whitman), fiction (McEwan, Chekhov, Gilman, Kafka), theater (Kushner), nonfiction prose (Defoe, Woolf), and critical theory (Scarry, Canguilhem, Sontag).
ENGL2505;;;Modern Global Poetry;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;;;;How do poems travel in the world? How does the world travel in poems? In this class, we will read poetry written in English from around the world, studying the way poems can speak beyond national borders. English language verse, from early 20th-century modernism to the present day, has sought new forms to face unprecedented global migrations, states of exile, technological interconnections, and ecological changes.  From sonnets to epics, World Wars to Google Earth, we will study poems that ask how race, class, and gender inflect the relationship between local life and cosmopolitan ambition. We will read poets such as T.S. Eliot, Rabindranath Tagore, W.B. Yeats, Lorna Goodison, Langston Hughes, W.H. Auden, Elizabeth Bishop, Derek Walcott, Daphne Marlatt, Christopher Okigbo, Louise Bennett, and Seamus Heaney.
ENGL2580;;;Imagining the Holocaust;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;COML2580;JWST2580;;;What is the role of the literary imagination in keeping the memory of the Holocaust alive for our culture? Within the historical context and raising ethical issues, we shall examine major and widely read Holocaust narratives that have shaped the way we understand and respond to the Holocaust. We shall begin with first-person reminiscences---Wiesel's Night, Levi's Survival at Auschwitz, and The Diary of Anne Frank---before turning to realistic fictions such as Kineally's Schindler's List (and Spielberg's film), Kertesz's Fateless, Kosinski's The Painted Bird, and Ozick's "The Shawl." We shall also read the mythopoeic vision of Schwarz-Bart's The Last of the Just, the illuminating distortions of Epstein's King of the Jews, the Kafkaesque parable of Appelfeld's Badenheim 1939, and the fantastic cartoons of Spiegelman's Maus books.
ENGL2600;;;Introduction to American Indian Literature;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;AIS2600;AMST2600;;;Both oral and written, Native literatures of the U.S. comprise a critical commentary on a range of ongoing issues facing the international community: the environment, sustainability, gender, capitalism, and colonialism. This course will discuss these issues from a Native perspective in fiction, poetry, non-fiction, and traditional oral narratives, ranging from before the European invasion of the Americas (1492) to the present, where  since the 1960s Native writers have been winning distinguished literary awards such as the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award.
ENGL2620;;;Introduction to Asian American Literature;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;AAS2620;AMST2620;;;This course will introduce both a variety of writings by Asian North American authors and some critical issues concerning the production and reception of Asian American texts. Working primarily with novels, we will be asking questions about the relation between literary forms and the socio-historical context within which they take on their meanings, and about the historical formation of Asian American identities.
ENGL2650;;;Introduction to African American Literature;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;AMST2650;ASRC2650;;;This course will introduce students to the African American literary tradition. Through aesthetic and contextual approaches, we will consider how African American life and culture has defined and constituted the United States of America. From slave narratives to Hip-Hop music, we will trace the range of artistic conventions and cultural movements while paying close attention to broader historical shifts in American life over the past three centuries. We will ask: How do authors create and define a tradition? What are some of the recurring themes and motifs within this tradition? Authors will include: Phillis Wheatley, David Walker, Frederick Douglass, Ida B. Wells-Barnett, W.E.B. DuBois, Zora Neal Hurston, Lorraine Hansberry, James Baldwin, Audre Lorde, Toni Morrison, and Paul Beatty.
ENGL2675;;;Cultures of the Cold War;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;AMST2675;;;This class aims to approach the literature and culture of the Cold War as the birth of the present "Age of Information," as well as the origin of modern notions of privacy that are now being superseded. We will begin with Hiroshima and the several forms of American anti-communism, and proceed from "containment culture" to the beginning of the counterculture, and from atomic weapons to the start of the environmental movement. Units of study will include intelligence (espionage), advertising (publicity), civil rights, and the public questioning of gender roles.  We will also view a few films and discuss music and painting of the period.  Authors include James Baldwin, Sylvia Plath, Marshall McLuhan, John Okada, Jack Kerouac, Frank O'Hara, Patricia Highsmith, and Rachel Carson.
ENGL2680;;;Culture and Politics of the 1960s;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;AMST2680;;;Nearly half a century ago, the civil rights movement, the Cold War, and Vietnam stimulated critiques and alternative lifestyles that changed American society forever. What can the experiences of young "boomers" who lived through the 1960s teach a later generation living through similar crises and hopes? This interdisciplinary course combines an historical overview with the close reading of texts, concentrating on racial justice, war, the counterculture, the New Left, the women's movement, and gay and lesbian rights. Texts will include The Autobiography of Malcolm X, Kubrick's film Dr. Strangelove, Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five, music of Dylan and Joplin, speeches of King, manifestos, memoirs, and poems.
ENGL2740;;;Scottish Literature;;;3-4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;MEDVL2740;;;Although Scotland, which was long a separate nation, is now politically united with England, it preserves its distinctiveness. This course provides an introduction to Scottish literature, with special emphasis on the medieval period and the 18th through the 20th centuries. The course should appeal to those who wish to learn about their Scottish heritage, and also those who simply wish to encounter a remarkable national culture and the literature it has produced. Some of the texts will be read in Scots, but no familiarity with Scots or earlier English is presumed. We welcome readers of literature who are not English majors.
ENGL2760;;;Desire;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;COML2760;FGSS2760;LGBT2760;PMA2680;;;"Language is a skin," the critic Roland Barthes once wrote: "I rub my language against the other. It is as if I had words instead of fingers, or fingers at the tip of my words. My language trembles with desire." Sexual desire has a history, even a literary history, which we will examine through an introductory survey of European dramatic literature from Plato and Aristophanes to Jean Genet and Caryl Churchill, as well as a survey of classic readings in Western sexual theory from the Ancient Greeks through Freud and Foucault to contemporary feminism and queer theory. Topics for discussion will include Greek pederasty, Christian mysticism, hysteria, sadomasochism, pornography, cybersex, and other performative pleasures.
ENGL2780;;;Body as Text: Pleasure and Danger;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;FGSS2780;LGBT2780;;;We experience our bodies as so much a part of who we are that we take them for granted. Yet the way we think about the body has a history of its own. This class looks at how the idea of "the body" gets constructed over time. How has the body come to have attributes called "gender," "sexuality," and "race"? Why have some bodies been seen as monstrous, perverted, and unholy, others as gorgeous, normal, and divine? What makes bodies pleasurable and dangerous? We'll find out by examining a broad range of evidence from the ancient era to the present day, including literature (Ovid, Kafka, Octavia Butler), philosophy (Plato, Descartes, Judith Butler), film, and the history of science.
ENGL2790;;;Lit! Literature and Intoxication;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;;;;This course explores ways that literature is a form of intoxication. Poetry and fiction have long been condemned for luring readers into decadence. Consider the Republic: Socrates bans poetry from his state. "Under the excitement of poetry," Socrates argues, citizens "neglect justice and virtue." Yet proponents celebrate imaginative writing for its mind-altering properties. A good novel is said to change one's thinking and even impart transcendence. In a letter, Emily Dickinson describes a potent buzz: "If I feel physically as if the top of my head were taken off, I know that is poetry." We'll read widely and closely to sample diverse literary highs and methods. We'll also consider humanity's complex relationship with intoxication and recent trends on college campuses.
ENGL2800;;;Introduction to Creative Writing;;;3;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;Prerequisite: completion of the First-Year Writing Seminar requirement.;;;;;;An introductory course in the theory, practice, and reading of fiction, poetry, and allied forms. Both narrative and verse readings are assigned. Students will learn to savor and practice the craft of poetry and narrative writing, developing techniques that inform both. Some class meetings may feature peer review of student work, and instructors may assign writing exercises or prompts.
ENGL2810;;;Introduction to Creative Writing;;;3;;;Spring, summer.;;;(LA-AS);;;Prerequisite: completion of the First-Year Writing Seminar requirement.;;;;;;An introductory course in the theory, practice, and reading of fiction, poetry, and allied forms. Both narrative and verse readings are assigned. Students will learn to savor and practice the craft of poetry and narrative writing, developing techniques that inform both. Some class meetings may feature peer review of student work, and instructors may assign writing exercises or prompts.
ENGL2880;;;Expository Writing;;;4;;;Fall, winter.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;;;;This course does not satisfy requirements for the English major. ENGL 2880 offers guidance and an audience for students who wish to gain skill in expository writing-a common term for critical, reflective, investigative, and creative nonfiction. Each section provides a context for writing defined by a form of exposition, a disciplinary area, a practice, or a topic intimately related to the written medium. Course members will read in relevant published material and write and revise their own work regularly, while reviewing and responding to one another's. Since these seminar-sized courses depend on members' full participation, regular attendance and submission of written work are required. Students and instructors will confer individually throughout the term.

ENGL2960;;;Linguistic Theory and Poetic Structure;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;ENGL6785;LING2285;LING6285;;;Poems are among the most highly structured linguistic objects that human beings produce. While some of the devices used in poetry are arbitrary and purely conventional, most are natural extensions of structural properties inherent in natural language itself. The aim of this course is to reveal the ways in which poetry is structured at every level, from rhyme to metaphor, and to show how certain results of modern linguistics can usefully be applied to the analysis and interpretation of poetry. After introducing some of the basic concepts of modern phonology, syntax and semantics, it will be shown how literary notions such as rhyme, meter, enjambment and metaphor can be formally defined in linguistic terms. These results will then be applied to the analysis of particular poems and shown to yield novel and interesting insights into both their structure and interpretation.
ENGL2999;;;The First American University;;;1;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;AMST2001;HIST2005;;;Educational historian Frederick Rudolph called Cornell University "the first American university," referring to its unique role as a coeducational, nonsectarian, land-grant institution with a broad curriculum and diverse student body. In this course, we will explore the history of Cornell, taking as our focus the pledge of Ezra Cornell and Andrew Dickson White to found a university where "any person can find instruction in any study." The course will cover a wide range of topics and perspectives relating to the faculty, student body, evolution of campus, and important events and eras in Cornell history. Stories and vignettes will provide background on the current university and its administrative structure, campus traditions, and the names that adorn buildings and memorials throughout campus. Finally, the course will offer a forum for students to address questions on present-day aspects of the university.
ENGL3021;;;Literary Theory on the Edge;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;COML3021;;;This course introduces the most exciting and cutting-edge theoretical advances of the 20th and 21st centuries. Taught by two Cornell professors active in the field, along with occasional invited guests, lectures will cover such movements as structuralism, deconstruction, trauma theory, biopolitics, human-animal studies and post-human studies. The specificity of the literary and the enigma of language in all its forms will remain a central focus in the course. Students will have the unique opportunity to develop a theory symposium. Course open to all levels; no previous knowledge of theory required.
ENGL3050;;;History of the Book;;;3;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;MEDVL3050;;;This course provides an overview of the book as a material and cultural artifact. Focusing on the era of the printed book (1450-2000) in Western Europe and America, we will examine the invention and spread of printing and publishing, and the evolution of book design, illustration, and binding. The course will place an emphasis on practical tools for the identification and analysis of books and other printed artifacts, especially for literary students. Investigations and assignments will be built around hands-on interaction with examples of Cornell Library's rare books and manuscripts.
ENGL3080;;;Icelandic Family Sagas;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;MEDVL3080;;;An introduction to Old Norse-Icelandic mythology and the Icelandic family saga-the "native" heroic literary genre of Icelandic tradition. Texts will vary but will normally include the Prose Edda, the Poetic Edda, Hrafnkels Saga, Njals Saga, Laxdaela Saga, and Grettirs Saga. All readings will be in translation.
ENGL3110;;;Old English;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;ENGL6110;MEDVL3110;MEDVL6110;;;In this course, we will read and discuss some of the earliest surviving English poetry and prose. Attention will be paid to (1) learning to read the language in which this literature is written, (2) evaluating the poetry as poetry: its form, structure, style, and varieties of meaning, and (3) seeing what can be learned about the culture of Anglo-Saxon England and about the early Germanic world in general, from an examination of the Old English literary records. We will begin by reading some easy prose and will go on to consider some more challenging heroic, elegiac, and devotional poetry, including an excerpt from the masterpiece Beowulf. The course may also be used as preparation for the sequence ENGL 3120/ENGL 6120.
ENGL3115;;;Video and New Media: Art, Theory, Politics;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;COML3115;PMA3515;VISST3115;;;The course will offer an overview of video art, alternative documentary video, and digital installation and networked art. It will analyze four phases of video and new media: (1) the development of video from its earliest turn away from television; (2) video's relation to art and installation; (3) video's migration into digital art; (4) the relation of video and new media to visual theory and social movements. Screenings will include early political and feminist video (Ant Farm, Rosler, Paper Tiger TV, Jones), conceptual video of the '80s and '90s (Vasulka, Lucier, Viola, Hill), gay and multicultural video of the '90s (Muntadas, Riggs, Piper, Fung, Parmar), networked and activist new media of the 21st century (Critical Art Ensemble, Electronic Disturbance Theater, SubRosa, Preemptive Media). Secondary theoretical readings on postmodernism, video theory, multicultural theory, and digital culture will provide students with a cultural and political context for the discussion of video and new media style, dissemination, and reception.
ENGL3120;;;Beowulf;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;Prerequisite: one semester's study of Old English or equivalent.;;;ENGL6120;MEDVL3120;MEDVL6120;;;A close reading of Beowulf. Attention will be given to relevant literary, cultural, and linguistic issues. One semester's study of Old English, or the equivalent, is recommended.
ENGL3140;;;Love and Ecstasy: Forms of Devotion in Medieval English Literature;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;MEDVL3140;;;What do love, torture, and ecstasy all have in common? How could they all be considered spiritual experiences? The thirteenth century brought a new and intense focus on the body of Christ, bloodied, wounded, and tortured. Female and male mystics began to describe Jesus as a lord, lover, and even mother in most intimate--and even sexual--terms. Guides for meditation, memory work, and holy living focused on bodily practices for approaching the divine and replicating the suffering of Christ. In this course we will explore a range of literary texts and artistic representations that illuminate this religious and aesthetic ethos. Readings will be in modern and medieval English, and will also include contemporary theoretical texts.
ENGL3190;;;Chaucer;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;MEDVL3190;;;Chaucer became known as the "father of English poetry" before he was entirely cold in his grave. Why is what he wrote more than six hundred years ago still riveting for us today? It's not just because he is the granddaddy of this language and its literature; it's because what he wrote was funny, fierce, thoughtful, political, philosophical and, oh yes, notoriously bawdy. We'll read some of Chaucer's brilliant early work, and then dig into his two greatest achievements: the epic Troilus and Crisyede, and The Canterbury Tales, his oft-censored panorama of medieval English life. Chaucer will be read in Middle English, which will prove surprisingly easy and pleasant.
ENGL3230;;;Renaissance Poetry;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;;;;From the sixteenth century to the present, love and its codes have intrigued writers and readers. What does it mean when love is the theme? Hearts, flowers, cupids? Seduction, ambition, power? How are private feelings and historical forces linked? Can writing poetry endanger your career or even your life? This course is for anyone interested in poetry, regardless of background, willing to work in a small discussion setting to examine the craft of lyric, ponder a range of questions, and think about the stakes of reading Renaissance poetry. Some of the authors and poems will be familiar to you (Shakespeare, Donne), others will be new. Our goal is to open windows for reading them. Expect the unexpected and some serious fun with rich material.
ENGL3270;;;Shakespeare: The Late Plays;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;PMA3770;;;The course focuses on Shakespeare's middle to late plays, from the "problem comedies," through the great tragedies, and romances. While we will pay particular attention to questions of dramatic form and historical context, the primary concentration will be on careful close readings of the play-texts themselves in relation to issues of power, politics, and performance. One of the commonplaces in Shakespeare criticism is a division between Shakespeare on the page and on the stage. Throughout the semester, we will consider what this difference could mean. On the way, we will encounter problems linked to art, sexuality, violence, identity, emotion, the body, family, God, the nation, nature and money (not necessarily in that order) - to name a few.
ENGL3300;;;Satire, Sensibility, and Sexuality in 18th Century Literature;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;;;;Close reading of texts in a variety of genres (poetry, fiction, drama, philosophy, autobiography, essay) will be guided by such topics as: the nature of satire, irony, and mock-forms; the politics of gender and sexuality; the authority and fallibility of human knowledge; the rhetoric of eighteenth-century verse forms; the aesthetics of the sublime and the beautiful; the Enlightenment as an intellectual movement. Works by such writers as Rochester, Behn, Dryden, Wycherley, Swift, Pope, Cleland, Johnson, Boswell, Sterne, Kant, and Cowper.
ENGL3330;;;Fictions of Self-Invention: The Eighteenth Century Novel;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;;;;If the Satanic fantasy is to believe ourselves "Self-begot, self-raised by our own quickning power" as Milton says, then the early novel is diabolical. Foundlings and orphans, abandoned wives, abducted daughters, incestuous marriages, exiled or restlessly traveling sons: early fiction imagines the possibility of socially inventing ourselves by challenging and leaving behind both the family defined by birth and a place called home. We will examine the ideology of self-invention-its promotion of individual autonomy through education, culture, sex, and economics-in such novels as Defoe's Moll Flanders, Haywood's Love in Excess, Fielding's Tom Jones, Austen's Emma. We will also examine how fiction tries to invent itself by turning to forms of realism and forgetting the history of literature.
ENGL3345;;;Modern British Drama on Stage and Screen;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;PMA3745;;;A survey of English drama on stage and screen from the late-nineteenth century to the present.  We will examine important dramatic forms and theatrical traditions while considering plays in their historical, cultural, and critical contexts. We will also explore film adaptations of these plays to consider the relationship between stage and screen in the modern era.   Readings/screenings will include works by Shaw, Wilde, Priestley, Churchill, Pinter, Stoppard, and Kane.
ENGL3360;;;American Drama and Theatre;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;AMST3360;PMA3757;;;Explores major American playwrights from 1900 to 1960, introducing students to American theatre as a significant part of modern American cultural history. We will consider the ways in which theatre has contributed to the construction and deconstruction of a national identity. Similarly, we will examine the influence of the American Theatre on and in film. We will pay special attention to the social, political, and aesthetic contexts of the time period and discuss the shifting popularity of dramatic forms, including melodrama, realism, expressionism, absurdism, and the folk play, in the American theatre canon. Authors include O'Neill, Glaspell, Odets, Rice, Hellman, Hughes, Miller, Williams, and Albee, among others.
ENGL3390;;;Jane Austen;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;;;;It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a student who has read Jane Austen must be in want of excuses to continue that delicious experience. This course explores Austen's characters, culture, and narrative art against the backdrop of films, novels, and poems which resonate with her fiction. We will investigate Austen's alluring mystique, her importance in literary history, and her continuing attraction in the twenty-first century. By immersing ourselves in her fictional worlds, we will enrich our experience of her novels and sharpen our awareness of the pleasures of reading.
ENGL3475;;;Global Shakespeare;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;COML3475;PMA3775;;;From Goethe to Aime Cesaire, Orson Welles to Akira Kurosawa, Agha Hashar Kashmiri to Ariane Mnouchkine, writers, artists, actors, and directors around the world have drawn from Shakespeare's works in order to fashion their own.  We will take a global journey from the Renaissance to the present day to discover both Shakespeare's creations and those he inspired.  This course may feature guest speakers, performances, and/or screenings, and specific works may vary from year to year.
ENGL3500;;;The High Modernist Tradition;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;;;;Critical study of major works by Joyce, Woolf, Conrad, Forster, Lawrence, Eliot, Yeats, Wilde, Hardy, Hopkins, and others, all of whom are indispensable for understanding subsequent literature. The emphasis will be on close reading of individual texts. We shall place the authors and works within the context of literary, political, cultural, and intellectual history. The course will seek to define the development of literary modernism (mostly but not exclusively in England), and relate literary modernism in England to that in Europe and America as well as to other intellectual developments. We shall be especially interested in the relationship between modern literature and modern painting and sculpture; on occasion, we shall look at slides. Within the course material, students will be able to select the topics on which they write essays.
ENGL3525;;;Twentieth Century American Poetry;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;AMST3525;;;Twentieth-century poetry has been closely identified with what Ezra Pound famously termed the challenge to "Make It New." Yet the question of just what "making it new" might mean was hotly contested throughout the century. Why did poets feel the need to make it new? What did making it new mean to people entering the institution of "poetry" from different social positions? American poetry diversified as it also rose in international influence. We will look at a number of different forms of poetry developed by poets from the United States, not forgetting to note the extent to which "Americanism" was or was not of concern to them in their experiments.
ENGL3550;;;Decadence;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;COML3550;FGSS3550;LGBT3550;;;"My existence is a scandal," Oscar Wilde once wrote, summing up in an epigram the effect of his carefully cultivated style of perversity and paradox. Through their celebration of "art for art's sake" and all that was considered artificial, unnatural, or obscene, the Decadent writers of the late-nineteenth century sought to free the pleasures of beauty, spirituality, and sexual desire from their more conventional ethical moorings. We will focus on the literature of the period, including works by Charles Baudelaire, Edgar Allan Poe, A. C. Swinburne, and especially Oscar Wilde, and we will also consider related developments in aesthetic philosophy, painting, music, theater, architecture, and design.
ENGL3672;;;Visualizing el Barrio: Interpreting and Documenting East Harlem's Mural Tradition;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;AMST3672;ARTH3670;LSP3672;VISST3670;;;Visualizing El Barrio immerses students in a semester-long contemplation and class project that integrates artistic praxis with art history and literary studies to document the historical murals of East Harlem, otherwise known as Spanish Harlem or "El Barrio."  These murals tell stories about people, places, and events that resonate with El Barrio's predominantly Latino/a community and American culture more broadly.  The murals in East Harlem emerge out of a rich Latin American artistic tradition that migrated with the people who comprise the U.S. Latino/a diaspora. Through student research and documentation, "Visualizing El Barrio" will also participate in the preservation of East Harlem's historical murals, culminating in a celebration of the artwork with a student-curated exhibit of photographs and presentations.
ENGL3690;;;The Race and Gender of Poverty in Literature and Film;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;AMST3690;FGSS3691;;;Poverty is an ongoing issue in the United States, and has intensified since the recession of 2008. As such, poverty has disproportionately affected women and underrepresented racial and ethnic communities. This course will analyze this issue through its representation in film and literature, both fiction and non-fiction.
ENGL3700;;;The Victorian Novel;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;;;;Jane Austen and zombies, A Christmas Carol in 3D, PBS miniseries: why is nineteenth-century fiction so un-dead? The plot of the Victorian novel-sexual betrayal, pathological greed, the sadistic damage wrought on helpless children-reflects wrenching social, scientific, and technological transformations whose global sweep rivals that of our own era's conflicts. Intertwining domestic and imperial spaces, realistic fiction embodied the most innovative attempt to grasp and contain such seismic shifts in an entertaining idiom for a rising mass readership. These works refract the cultural debates of the age and suggest sources of redemption. We can take pleasure in them even as we critically analyze how the Victorians live now. Likely authors include: Dickens, Gaskell, Bronte, Eliot, Collins and Hardy.
ENGL3740;;;Contemporary African American Poetry;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;AMST3742;ASRC3740;;;This course will examine a variety of voices in contemporary African American poetry, focusing on works produced in the decades following the Civil Rights and Black Power Movements. We will consider how new generations of black poets are using verse to represent personal and collective history; to interrogate race and other social categories like gender and sexuality; and to ungate new perspectives for understanding the human condition. Along with verse, we will also study other forms of poetry like Hip Hop and spoken word that inform the contemporary African American lyric. Authors will include Rita Dove, Yusef Komunyakaa, Elisabeth Alexander, Natasha Trethewey, Terrance Hayes, and Lyrae Van Clief-Stefanon.
ENGL3762;;;Law and Literature;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;ENGL6710;GOVT6045;LAW6710;;;What can lawyers and judges learn from the study of literature? This course explores the relevance of imaginative literature (novels, drama, poetry, and film) to questions of law and social justice from a range of perspectives. We will consider debates about how literature can help to humanize legal decision-making; how storytelling has helped to give voice to oppressed populations over history; how narratives of suffering cultivate popular support for human rights; the role played by storytelling in a trial; and how literature can shed light on the limits of law and public policy.
ENGL3790;;;Reading Nabokov;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;COML3815;RUSSL3385;;;This course offers an exciting trip to the intricate world of Nabokov's fiction. After establishing himself in Europe as a distinguished Russian writer, Nabokov, at the outbreak of World War II, came to the United States where he reestablished himself, this time as an American writer of world renown. In our analysis of Nabokov's fictional universe, we shall focus on his Russian corpus of works, from Mary (1926) to The Enchanter (writ. 1939), all in English translation, and then shall examine the two widely read novels which he wrote in English in Ithaca while teaching literature at Cornell: Lolita (1955) and Pnin (1957).
ENGL3805;;;Literary Translation: Don't Shoot the Messenger;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;;;;This is a creative writing seminar for students wishing to enrich their writer's imagination through the art of literary translation. Whatever gets lost in translation, let's hope that it won't be us. We will examine theories of translation, and the intriguing relationship between author, translator, and text. We will analyze various literary texts and convey them in contemporary English focusing on the nuances of voice, tone, and style. Knowledge of other languages is a plus, but not a requirement.
ENGL3810;;;Uncanny Reading, Canny Critical Writing;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;;;;Reading and writing are uncanny practices: the ghosts of earlier fictions return in later ones, which "read" their precursors hauntedly. And canny critical writing repeats the process explicitly and clearly. In this course we'll read Vladimir Nabokov's Pale Fire; Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre with Jean Rhys's Wide Sargasso Sea and Henry James's Turn of the Screw; a tale by E.T.A. Hoffmann and a treatise by Sigmund Freud; Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness and its postcolonial revision, Tayeb Salih's Season of Migration to the North; and Virginia Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway with Michael Cunningham's The Hours. We'll write frequently and read one another's works as collaborators and critics, producing portfolios of finished prose by the semester's end. See http://courses.cit.cornell.edu/sad4449/3810/.

ENGL3860;;;Philosophic Fictions;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;;;;"Fictions" of thought and language abound in all good writing, especially in works that deliberately test and play with ideas: dialogues, satires, parables, philosophic tales, and "thought-experiments." Students will write critically about such works and will experiment with writing in similar forms in order to argue flexibly, ridicule vice and folly, or involve readers in pleasingly or disturbingly insoluble problems. Readings may include Plato's Gorgias or Republic, Swift's "Modest Proposal" and Gulliver's Travels, parables by Jesus and  Kafka, dystopias by Caryl Churchill and George Saunders, science fiction by Octavia Butler and the Wachowski brothers, short stories by Jorge Luis Borges and Flannery O'Connor, and essays by Richard Rorty and Terry Eagleton. See http://courses.cit.cornell.edu/sad4449/3860/.
ENGL3890;;;The Personal Voice: Nonfiction Writing;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;;;;Writers of creative nonfiction plumb the depths of their experience and comment memorably on the passing scene. They write reflectively on themselves and journalistically on the activities and artifacts of others. The voice they seek is at once uniquely personal, objectively persuasive, and accessible to others who want relish their view of the world and learn from it. This course is for the maturely self-motivated writer (beyond the first year of college) who wants to experiment with style and voice to find new writerly personae in a workshop environment. During the semester, we'll read enabling models of literary nonfiction, including one another's, and work to develop a portfolio of diverse and polished writing.
ENGL4161;;;Literature of the Crusades;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;ENGL6161;MEDVL4161;MEDVL6161;;;The Crusades occupied brief periods, with events far from most Western writers, but kept a long hold on European historical, religious, and literary imagination. This provides an opportunity to consider how literature responds to ideological and military conflict. Exploring the ideas leading to the Crusades, and some narratives from those directly involved, from the Chanson de Roland to other French and Latin chronicles and poems, the course will consider a wide span of later Middle English literature from romances to the works of Chaucer and his contemporaries in order to reconsider the imprint of the Crusades on the wider English literary tradition. Goals include gaining proficiency in Middle English and its literature, as well as theories of how narrative responds to cultural and ideological crisis.
ENGL4180;;;The Imaginary Jew: Roots of Antisemitism in Medieval England;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ENGL6180;JWST4180;JWST6180;MEDVL4180;MEDVL6180;;;When did anti-Semitism begin? The medieval period invented shocking fictions about Jews--that they killed and ate Christian babies; that they desecrated the Host; that they were the murderers of Christ. In manuscripts Jews were visually compared to beasts, devils, and perverts. By law, Jews were forced to live in ghettos, wear distinctive dress, abstain from certain professions, and suffer exile. Beginning with Shakespeare's Shylock, we will work our way back through visual and literary treatments of Jews in the Middle Ages, reading texts by Chaucer, chronicles, miracle stories, crusader romances, and mystery plays. Drawing on recent theories of the other we will also consider how medieval representations of Jews and other minorities were used to construct medieval communal, religious, and political identities.
ENGL4260;;;The Animal;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;COML4240;GERST4260;GOVT4279;;;In recent years literary representations and philosophical discussions of the status of the animal vis-a-vis the human have abounded. In this course, we will track the literary phenomenology of animality. In addition we will read philosophical texts that deal with the questions of animal rights and of the metaphysical implications of the "animal." Readings may include, among others, Agamben, Aristotle, Berger, the Bible, Calvino, Coetzee, Darwin, Derrida, Descartes, Donhauser, Gorey, Haraway, Hegel, Heidegger, Herzog, Kafka, Kant, La Mettrie, de Mandeville, Montaigne, Nietzsche, Ozeki, Rilke, Schopenhauer, Singer, Sorabji, Sterchi, Stevens, de Waal, Wittgenstein, Wolfe. A reading knowledge of German and French would be helpful.
ENGL4270;;;Advanced Seminar in Shakespeare;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;ENGL6270;;;Some of Shakespeare's most important dramas are about ancient figures and events: Julius Caesar, Antony and Cleopatra, Troilus and Cressida, among others. While Shakespeare transmits a classical cultural heritage to his early modern audience, he critically adapts it in thought-provoking and innovative ways. Many of Shakespeare's major characters in these plays act as representatives of classical authority and yet are profoundly in conflict with it. While remaining attentive to complexities and indeterminacies in these texts, what responses-resistance, identification, affirmation, accommodation-are available to an author? What is the political charge of Roman (republican) plays in the context of English monarchy? What can we say about the politics of Shakespeare's adaptive practices? What political and cultural questions, past and present, do they raise?
ENGL4291;;;American Shakespeare;;;4;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;What is distinctive about American Shakespeare? Is it merely a less confident cousin of its more prestigious UK relative; or does it have a character of its own? What is currently happening with 'American Shakespeare' that is not happening anywhere else? This course is designed explicitly to exploit the wide variety of human and material resources of the DC and surrounding area, such as the Folger Shakespeare Library and Theatre, the Shakespeare Theatre and the Blackfriars Playhouse at Staunton. While encountering a number of plays, students will have the opportunity to see at least three live performances and numerous movies, consider the history of Shakespeare in America and learn from actors, directors, scholars and designers.
ENGL4313;;;The Beautiful Struggle: Radical Aesthetics and Politics;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;AMST4313;;;Now let us begin.  Now let us rededicate ourselves to the long and bitter, but beautiful, struggle for a new world. The course will begin from the declaration made by Martin Luther King, Jr. that the struggle for a new world, inevitably political, is also beautiful, that is, that it is involved with aesthetics. "The struggle is beautiful, I'm too strong for your slavery," raps Talib Kweli, thirty-seven years after King's speech.  What did King mean, and what have others in American culture meant, when they invoked beauty and struggle in the same breath?  What have the arts and radical politics had to do with each other?  When have radical politics and experimental aesthetics needed each other?  We will work with all forms of the arts; discussion will figure heavily in this effort; political and aesthetic theory will surface regularly.
ENGL4340;;;Dreaming Romanticism;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;COML4152;;;The story of the Fall, in John Milton's Paradise Lost, is also a story of dreams. Woven into the epic tale of our first encounter with mortality, Adam's and Eve's trances and dream-life tell their own stories within the grand narrative of human beginnings and raise questions about the nature of poetic language in the face of  life and death. In this course we will trace the perplexing stories of these dreams as they pass from Milton to the Romantic poets, whose poetry can be said to rewrite the peculiar relation between falling and dreaming in a new language of mortality and survival. Authors will include John Milton, William Wordsworth, John Keats, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and Mary Shelley, among others.
ENGL4450;;;Text Analysis for Production: How to Get from the Text onto the Stage;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;Prerequisite: PMA 2600 or PMA 2810 or PMA 3880.;;;PMA4650;VISST4545;;;Examines the play as the central, essential source for production decisions made by the actor, the director, the designer, and the dramaturg. Students "present" their conclusions about the performance of studied texts through project work as either an actor, director, designer, or dramaturg, as well as through two to three papers.
ENGL4490;;;Wordsworth and Rousseau;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;COML4610;;;This course brings together two great writers of violently different styles, temperaments, and relationships to the French Revolution. Rousseau's writings will be provided in English as well as in French. Wordsworth's poem on "the growth of a poet's mind" will be contrasted with Rousseau's revelatory Confessions: we shall ask about how they reflect guilt, represent happiness, and convey experiences of time and memory. We shall read Rousseau's Discourse on the Origin of Inequality and Wordsworth's manifestos for his poetry. Reading closely some of Wordsworth's poems, we will consider why it makes sense to think of them--like Rousseau's late autobiographical essays--as "reveries of a solitary walker." No previous knowledge of Rousseau, Wordsworth, or Romanticism is required.
ENGL4491;;;Romanticism and the Fate of the Senses;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;COML4019;SHUM4991;STS4981;;;What if, William Blake once asked, every bird that flies "is an immense world of delight, closed by your senses five?" Asking what real and possible worlds our habits of sensory perception exclude, Romantic poets criticized their culture's increasing faith in sense-based, empirical knowledge - knowledge supposedly free from subjective bias, historical circumstance, national prejudice, and political complicity. This seminar will focus on poetry as a form of sensory re-training and on Romantic and post-Romantic claims to a politics of perception. Can artworks access rival science, non-human experience, or otherwise unthinkable histories - or sensually suspend the pressure to do so? Readings from Blake, Keats, Dickinson, Goethe, Locke, Foucault, Latour, Daston, Ranciere, Bourdieu, Williams, de Man, Adorno, Terada, Stewart, and Hartman.
ENGL4503;;;Picturing the U.S. Slave Narrative;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;ASRC4503;;;Before the advent of technologies like Facebook and Twitter, nineteenth-century viewers used new visual technologies-like collectible card-photographs and illustrated newspapers-to share information or publically debate social problems. In an effort to garner support for slavery's abolition, U.S. anti-slavery activists embraced "illustrations," "scenes," and "pictures," as key rhetorical tools, using them to provide "ocular proof" of slavery's horrors and abolition's necessity. Via hands-on interaction with nineteenth-century images, and classroom study of slave narratives, illustrated newspapers, and photo-texts, we will pinpoint how visual images transformed not only the nineteenth-century slave narrative, but also its many literary after-lives. By reading nineteenth-century visual culture against more contemporary representations of slavery like Toni Morrison's 1988 novel Beloved, Kyle Baker's 2005 graphic novel, Nat Turner, and Steve McQueen's 2014 Academy-Award Winning film Twelve Years a Slave, we'll revise how we define a key genre in American literary studies.
ENGL4510;;;James Baldwin & Philosophy;;;4;;;;;;;;;;;;ASRC4110;ASRC6110;;;
ENGL4522;;;Magical Realism: Ireland and the Postcolonial World;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;;;;This course will study transnational cross-pollinations among Irish, Latin American, Indian, and Caribbean writers who transgress the boundaries between the enchantment of fantasy and the seeming rationality of the material world. What role do ghosts, miracles, and wondrous transformations play in the social and aesthetic imagination of nations emerging from colonial oppression? Ireland will form our central case study: Irish writers since the 1940s have drawn on the folk legacy of the Celtic Revival while mixing in new inspiration from the hybrid modes of authors such as Borges and Rushdie. By tracing a line of influence that runs from Joyce to Garcia Marquez to Anne Enright, we will map the circulation of the uncanny and the uncontainable across the crumbling borders of the contemporary globe.
ENGL4575;;;"The Hero Can't Be Dead Until the Last Reel": Caribbean Cinema and Society;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;;;;This course will trace the early cinema of the Caribbean ("The Harder They Come," "Black Shack Alley," etc.) up to recent 'new wave' films ("Better Mus' Come," "SistaGod," etc.), within context of the Caribbean's socio-political, historical, and literary trends. Along with regular viewing of films and listening to music, several fiction and non-fiction texts will be studied. Close attention will be paid to how the 'cinematic gaze' represents a society which is still defining itself since the end of the colonial period.
ENGL4600;;;Melville;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;AMST4600;;;An American whose life and writing ranged over the globe, Herman Melville (in the estimation of C.L.R. James) "saw the tendency of things." Our study of the fiction and poetry will turn on some of those "things" of modernity that most obsessively engaged Melville's representational and critical capacities: slavery; illegitimate authority; exterminationist policy directed against American Indians; capitalism; orphanhood and homelessness; imperialism; the attempted occultation of women; the shifting terrain of male comradeship; and the ambivalent resort to religion. We will be interested in testing the premise that Melville charted the fault lines of his world with an "unenrolled" critical acuity unparalleled in United States literature.
ENGL4603;;;Black Women Writers of the South;;;4;;;;;;;;;;;;ASRC4403;ASRC6403;FGSS4403;FGSS6403;;;This course considers the new generation of writers of black women that has emerged in the U.S. South in more recent years, whose writings have increasingly impacted the development of contemporary African American literature. Genres that we will explore include the novel, poetry and essay and memoir. We will consider a range of authors, including Tayari Jones, Shay Youngblood, Honoree Jeffers, and Natasha Tretheway. Concomitantly, we will explore the visual art of Kara Walker. We will consider ways in which these writers build upon established themes and conventions in African American and black women's writing and the implications of their work for black feminist theory.   Furthermore, we will examine the impact of their work within the emergent field of twenty-first century African American literature and criticism.
ENGL4620;;;Building a Verbal-Visual Movement: Chicano/a & US Latino/a Art Stories;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;AMST4301;LSP4620;;;This seminar focuses on Chicano/a and U.S. Latino/a art movements in the 1960s and 1970s. We will examine their different and interrelated social, political, and economic origins within a larger civil rights movement, as well as their aesthetic, literary, and cultural legacies in the twenty-first century. Theorizing that Chicano/a and U.S. Latino/a artists built a verbal-visual architecture for the civil rights platforms of the 1960s and 1970s, we will examine visual icons, verbal slogans, motifs, and sounds that created and fortified an exciting and complex lexicon, visual culture, and poetics of an American experience. Students will also learn about and engage archives and special collections at Cornell and other institutions that house extensive works from this prolific era of artistic and cultural production. Artists, poets, and authors include: Jose Montoya, Yolanda Lopez, Pedro Pietri, Patssi Valdez, Asco, Miguel Pinero, Sandra Maria Esteves, Luis Valdez, Ester Hernandez, Alfredo de Batuc, Carmen Tafolla, and others.
ENGL4700;;;Reading Joyce's Ulysses;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;COML4831;;;A thorough episode-by-episode study of the art and meaning of Joyce's masterwork Ulysses, the most influential book of the twentieth century. We shall place Ulysses in the context of Joyce's canon, Irish culture, and literary modernism. We shall explore the relationship between Ulysses and other experiments in modernism-especially painting and sculpture-and show how Ulysses redefines the concepts of epic, hero, and reader. We shall examine Ulysses as a political novel-specifically, Joyce's response to Yeats and the Celtic Renaissance; Joyce's role in the debate about the direction of Irish politics after Parnell; and Joyce's response to British colonial occupation of Ireland. We shall also consider Ulysses as an urban novel in which Bloom, the marginalized Jew and outsider, is symptomatic of the kind of alienation created by urban culture. No previous experience with Joyce is required.
ENGL4741;;;Body Politics in African Literature and Cinema;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ASRC4995;ASRC6945;COML4945;COML6945;FGSS4945;FGSS6945;LGBT4945;LGBT6945;VISST4945;VISST6945;;;The course examines how postcolonial African writers and filmmakers engage with and revise controversial images of bodies and sexuality-genital cursing, same-sex desire, HIV/AIDS, genital surgeries, etc. Our inquiry also surveys African theorists' troubling of problematic tropes and practices such as the conception in 19th-century racist writings of the colonized as embodiment, the pathologization and hypersexualization of colonized bodies, and the precarious and yet empowering nature of the body and sexuality in the postcolonial African experience. As we focus on African artists and theorists, we also read American and European theorists, including but not certainly limited to Giorgio Agamben, Michel Foucault, Roland Barthes, and Joseph Slaughter, detecting the ways in which discourses around bodies in the African context may shape contemporary theories and vice versa.
ENGL4745;;;The Turning Point: American Literature and Culture in the 1940s;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;Prerequisite: At least one English class at the 3000-level or above.;;;AMST4745;;;The War. The Bomb. Planetary Consciousness. Film Noir. In one of the most pivotal decades in history, the United States emerged as a superpower and its literature achieved a prestige unmatched before or since.  We will examine literary and other responses to the tumultuous events of the 1940s, from fascism's spread across Europe to the onset of the Cold War. Writers and artists, far from triumphalist, questioned the nature of humanity in the wake of incomprehensible catastrophe. A planetary consciousness emerged along with the modern ecological movement and the UN. Expect to read major authors like Richard Wright, Gertrude Stein, and Ernest Hemingway, novels of the war and a classic ecological treatise, alongside film and visual arts.
ENGL4766;;;Practicum in Performance Criticism and Dramaturgy;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;ENGL6766;PMA4866;PMA6866;;;The function of the theatre critic is well understood, but the role of the dramaturg remains mysterious in the American theatre.  Yet theatre critics and dramaturgs use many of the same research, analytic, and writing skills, and need the same knowledge of history, literature, and culture, to perform their duties effectively.  This practicum, designed for advanced undergraduates and graduate students, will allow participants to develop the skills central to these complementary professions.  The course will include units on writing effective performance reviews, working with student playwrights on new script development, preparing informational materials for directors, designers and actors, writing program essays and other informational materials for audiences, script preparation for production, and selecting/preparing translations for production. While our focus will be on the theatre, students with interest in applying these skills to film/television/media or dance contexts are welcome.
ENGL4770;;;Transits of Empire: Early American and Native American Travel Writing;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;AMST4770;;;This course examines early American travel literature by and about Native Americans in a comparative perspective. Beginning with Columbus's Diario, we will move sweepingly through to the 1830s, viewing along the way the writing of a broad group of travelers including Lewis and Clark, and Edgar Allan Poe. As a body of literature, their work observes and imagines "new" lands and places as a way of constructing and, occasionally, questioning colonial knowledge about Native others. Crucially, we will also be reading texts written by Native American authors (Samson Occom, William Apess, George Copway, and Black Hawk, among others), whose physical and narrative movements in and among Native networks here and abroad challenged colonial powers through their assertions of longstanding geopolitics, kinship systems, and cosmologies.
ENGL4773;;;Narrative and Moral Crisis;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;COML4773;;;It is often said that literature encourages ethical reflection, and even that it somehow fortifies our disposition to behave in ethical ways. This class will consider a different possibility, that literature, or narrative more generally, often represents or provokes circumstances of extreme moral uncertainty. Such uncertainty, sometimes focused in a moment of decision and sometimes arising from a clash of perspectives, can gather around characters, narrators, authors, and even readers. We will be focusing intensively on a few works of literary and cinematic art, ranging from the Book of Genesis to Ian McEwan's Atonement, in which moral issues emerge with particular urgency and complexity.
ENGL4798;;;Writing Muslims: Literature and Film of Muslim Diaspora(s);;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;COML4601;NES4707;RELST4707;;;How and where does-indeed, can-one write the story of a diaspora of the Muslim creative and critical imagination? Guided by the critical work of e.g. Hawley, Rushdie, and Subramani, we will read and watch the works of Leila Aboulela, Zulfikar Ghose, Abdulrazak Gurnah, Mohja Kahf, Sorayya Khan, Manzu Islam, Hanif Kureishi, Ian Iqbal Rashid and others. We will critique, evaluate, and enjoy these works through the lens of the diasporic condition, by paying special attention to the effects of displacement and its impact on articulations of faith, history, identity, memory, mythologies, nation(alism), subjugation, the postmodern, and the (post)postcolonial. All readings and films in English.

ENGL4840;;;Postcolonial Poetry and the Poetics of Relation;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;COML4290;COML6350;ENGL6850;FREN4350;FREN6350;SPAN4350;SPAN6350;;;What kinds of poetry might be usefully characterized as "postcolonial" and what are the stakes of such a designation? How common, variable, translatable are values deemed "postcolonial" for particular poetics across cultures? Is there such a thing as a transnational, transcultural, "Postcolonial Poetics?" What relation(s) do specific textual/poetic features or strategies have to geopolitical, cultural, historical, economic circumstances, and to the condition(s) of what has come to be called the "postcolonial" in particular? With special reference to Edouard Glissant's influential concept of a "poetics of relation," attending as well to our own situatedness as readers-perhaps also, though not necessarily, as writers-of poetry within U.S. (and) academic context(s), this seminar will focus on Caribbean poetry as an especially fruitful site for exploring a diversity of approaches to these and related questions concerning postcoloniality, poetry, community, language, culture, and identity.
ENGL4910;;;Honors Seminar I;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;Seminar  101: Contemporary Black Literature and Art
ENGL4920;;;Honors Seminar II;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;The purpose of the Honors Seminar is to acquaint students with methods of study and research to help them write their senior Honors Essay. However, all interested students are welcome to enroll. The seminar will require a substantial essay that incorporates literary evidence and critical material effectively, and develops an argument. Topics and instructors vary each semester.

ENGL4992;;;Affective Ecologies;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;COML4026;FGSS4992;LGBT4992;SHUM4992;;;This seminar considers the points of intersection between theories of affect, emotion, and sexuality in recent queer and feminist thought, and the set of critical and cultural developments that has come to be called the "nonhuman turn." We will explore contemporary critical attention to the agential, sensory and cognitive capacities of the non-human, considering how this body of work reconfigures the relations between human and nonhuman worlds, and the more flexible and nuanced accounts of "nature" and "environments" that they make possible. At the same time, we will examine how the radically expanded ethos of being-in-common proposed by the non-human turn operates alongside the structures and histories of dehumanization to which and feminist, queer and critical race theory have drawn our attention.
ENGL4994;;;Archiving Sensation;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;COML4027;FGSS4994;LGBT4994;SHUM4994;;;This course will address the 2014-15 Society for Humanities theme of "sensation" through questions of method, focusing in particular on the interdisciplinary challenges of documenting and archiving sensation. Areas of focus will include: theory and practice of the archive from both queer studies and postcolonial studies; intersections of queer theory and affect theory that explore non-normative experiences of sensation, attachment, and intimacy; questions of genre and media, with particular emphasis on the limits and possibilities of "writing" sensation as opposed to representing it in other media, especially experimental and new media practices such as performance and art installation that are more explicitly embodied and/or material.
ENGL4999;;;Transformations of Sense and Early Modern Thought;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;CLASS4999;COML4028;SHUM4999;;;This seminar investigates concepts of sensation in classical and early modern literature and philosophy, with a particular focus on 16th and 17th century writers. On the one hand, changing ideas of sensation may reflect significant shifts in western histories of physiology and selfhood, and the seminar will attend to these familiar themes. But on the other hand, the topic of sensation suggests ways of reading classical and early modern literature as transhistorical works of art, following Deleuze and Guattari's claim that "Art thinks no less than philosophy, but it thinks through affects and percepts" that form "compounds of sensations." We'll focus on the interweaving of sensation with physiology and environment, through attention to Metamorphosis, Humoral Embodiment, and Darkness. Readings include Aristotle, Ovid, Seneca, Shakespeare, Spenser, Milton, Hobbes, Descartes, Spinoza, Deleuze &amp; Guattari, Foucault, Heidegger, and Cassirer.

ENGL6000;;;Colloquium for Entering Students;;;2;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;An introduction to practical and theoretical aspects of graduate English studies, conducted with the help of weekly visitors from the English department. There will be regular short readings and brief presentations, but no formal papers. The colloquium is required for all entering PhD students; MFA students are welcome to attend any sessions that interest them.
ENGL6001;;;Advanced Pedagogy Workshop;;;1;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;This workshop is designed to help graduate instructors build their teaching portfolios. We will be drafting statements of teaching philosophy, designing and workshopping sample courses, and developing a professional pedagogical profile. The workshop is required for all PhD and MFA students during their first semester of teaching. The class will meet twice a month, September through November.
ENGL6110;;;Old English;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;ENGL3110;MEDVL3110;MEDVL6110;;;In this course, we will read and discuss some of the earliest surviving English poetry and prose. Attention will be paid to (1) learning to read the language in which this literature is written, (2) evaluating the poetry as poetry: its form, structure, style, and varieties of meaning, and (3) seeing what can be learned about the culture of Anglo-Saxon England and about the early Germanic world in general, from an examination of the Old English literary records. We will begin by reading some easy prose and will go on to consider some more challenging heroic, elegiac, and devotional poetry, including an excerpt from the masterpiece Beowulf. The course may also be used as preparation for the sequence ENGL 3120/ENGL 6120.
ENGL6120;;;Beowulf;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;One semester's study of Old English, or the equivalent, is recommended.;;;ENGL3120;MEDVL3120;MEDVL6120;;;A close reading of Beowulf. Attention will be given to relevant literary, cultural, and linguistic issues.
ENGL6155;;;Theory & Analysis of Narrative;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;COML6793;;;Study of short stories and a novel that self-consciously foreground questions of narrative form and technique and the process of reading. Authors to be read include Balzac, Borges, Barth, Calvino, Cortazar, Kafka, and others selected by the students themselves. We will also read theoretical essays on the analysis of narrative by Barthes, Bakhtin, Booth, Genette, Fludernik, Pratt, Altman, Shklovsky, and others, focusing on questions about relations between plot and narrative discourse, the discrimination of narrators, the role of gender, and interpretive frameworks for thinking about narrative. Short exercises, an oral report and a longer paper.
ENGL6161;;;Literature of the Crusades;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;ENGL4161;MEDVL4161;MEDVL6161;;;The Crusades occupied brief periods, with events far from most Western writers, but kept a long hold on European historical, religious, and literary imagination. This provides an opportunity to consider how literature responds to ideological and military conflict. Exploring the ideas leading to the Crusades, and some narratives from those directly involved, from the Chanson de Roland to other French and Latin chronicles and poems, the course will consider a wide span of later Middle English literature from romances to the works of Chaucer and his contemporaries in order to reconsider the imprint of the Crusades on the wider English literary tradition. Goals include gaining proficiency in Middle English and its literature, as well as theories of how narrative responds to cultural and ideological crisis.
ENGL6180;;;The Imaginary Jew: Roots of Antisemitism in Medieval England;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;ENGL4180;JWST4180;JWST6180;MEDVL4180;MEDVL6180;;;When did anti-Semitism begin? The medieval period invented shocking fictions about Jews--that they killed and ate Christian babies; that they desecrated the Host; that they were the murderers of Christ. In manuscripts Jews were visually compared to beasts, devils, and perverts. By law, Jews were forced to live in ghettos, wear distinctive dress, abstain from certain professions, and suffer exile. Beginning with Shakespeare's Shylock, we will work our way back through visual and literary treatments of Jews in the Middle Ages, reading texts by Chaucer, chronicles, miracle stories, crusader romances, and mystery plays. Drawing on recent theories of the other we will also consider how medieval representations of Jews and other minorities were used to construct medieval communal, religious, and political identities.
ENGL6270;;;Advanced Seminar in Shakespeare;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;ENGL4270;;;Some of Shakespeare's most important dramas are about ancient figures and events: Julius Caesar, Antony and Cleopatra, Troilus and Cressida, among others. While Shakespeare transmits a classical cultural heritage to his early modern audience, he critically adapts it in thought-provoking and innovative ways. Many of Shakespeare's major characters in these plays act as representatives of classical authority and yet are profoundly in conflict with it. While remaining attentive to complexities and indeterminacies in these texts, what responses-resistance, identification, affirmation, accommodation-are available to an author? What is the political charge of Roman (republican) plays in the context of English monarchy? What can we say about the politics of Shakespeare's adaptive practices? What political and cultural questions, past and present, do they raise?
ENGL6390;;;Studies in Romanticism: Pleasure and Knowledge in Wordsworth and Keats;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;This seminar seeks to be both a thorough and a focused introduction to the writing of two crucial English poets. Making a claim for the importance of poetry, Wordsworth asserted, "We have no knowledge but what has been built up by pleasure." Reading closely texts of Wordsworth, Keats, and their critics, we will ask what kinds of knowledge issue from the pleasure their poetry imparts. In addition, we will reconsider Wordsworth's and Keats's poetry in relation to the Enlightenment idea that pleasure is an essential constituent of sociability. Their poetry reflects this idea in radically different ways, in a contrast of styles-and of relations to gender and class-that we will try to distinguish and interpret. Two ten-or-more page papers required.
ENGL6430;;;Trauma Theory Today;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;COML6156;;;This course examines the history, and historicity, of the theory of trauma at crucial moments in the 20th and 21st centuries. We will examine major theoretical texts in relation to their historical contexts and more recent attempts to expand the field in new directions, including terrorism, nuclear threat, ecological catastrophe, neuroscience, legal contexts, political discourse, theological discourse, and non-Western contexts.. Questions will concern the nature of history, event, and testimonial archive as well as the changing question of (the language of) witness in a world in which traumatic repetition is bound up with historical erasure. Guest speakers include Robert Jay Lifton, Shoshana Felman, Elisabeth Weber, Elizabeth Rottenberg, John Zilkosky, Peter Balakian, Carolyn Dean, among others.
ENGL6490;;;Aesthetics and the Imagination in the 19th Century;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;A survey of 19C British cultural and literary criticism that follows the shift from a Romantic perspective centered on the author (when terms like "imagination" and "the poet" predominate) to the Victorian perspective centered on the viewer (when terms like "beauty" and "the artist" begin to predominate). Our interest will also be psychological and political, as we trace the way notions of the poet or artist imply shifting conceptions of identity and presence, and the way models of aesthetic form embody emerging conceptions of social structure and gender dynamics. We'll end by connecting nineteenth-century writers with the revival of interest in pleasure and aesthetics in literary studies today. Authors will include Schiller, Coleridge, Marx, Ruskin, Pater, and Wilde.
ENGL6530;;;The Modern Imagination;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;I imagine this as an indispensable course for those studying late nineteenth, twentieth and contemporary century literature as well as for MFAs. We shall read major works by Joyce, Woolf, Conrad, Forster, Lawrence, Yeats, and T.S.Eliot as well as works by Proust, Kafka, and Mann. The emphasis will be on close reading of individual texts, but we shall place the authors and works within the context of literary, political, cultural, and intellectual history. The course will seek to define the development of literary modernism and relate literary modernism to other intellectual developments. We shall be especially interested in the relationship between modern literature and modern painting and sculpture. Within the course material, students will be able to select the topics on which they write essays.
ENGL6553;;;Erotics of Instruction;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;LGBT6553;;;Instruction is a sensual experience with innumerable orientations: teaching, learning, analyzing, interrogating, suspecting, lecturing, suggesting, introducing, initiating, mentoring, indoctrinating, exhibiting, proving, disproving, discrediting, discovering, disavowing, and always, always discussing. We will discuss a range of classic texts on the relation of pleasure, power, and knowledge in the erotics of instruction, inside the classroom and out. We will begin with Plato's Symposium and trace its reimagination and critique through psychoanalytic, deconstructive, feminist, and queer theory. In this framework, we will explore works of erotic philosophy by Sigmund Freud, Jacques Lacan, Michel Foucault, Roland Barthes, Jacques Derrida, David Halperin, Jane Gallop, and Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, among others, as well as related works of contemporary cinema. 
ENGL6612;;;Colonial American Literature;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;AMST6612;;;The American Revolution was a war fought by European settlers against England that ended the colonial domination of these settlers in the founding of the United States. But the settlers were themselves colonizers of American Indian land and nations and African labor: founders of a legalized colonialism that while it ended formally for African Americans with the Thirteenth Amendment continues today under the force of federal Indian law for the Native peoples of what became the United States. Reading Native American, African American, and Euramerican texts within a time frame that extends from 1492 to the end of the 18th century, the course will study the conflicts of colonial settlement that generated the United States past and present.
ENGL6710;;;Law and Literature;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;ENGL3762;GOVT6045;LAW6710;;;What can lawyers and judges learn from the study of literature? This course explores the relevance of imaginative literature (novels, drama, poetry, and film) to questions of law and social justice from a range of perspectives. We will consider debates about how literature can help to humanize legal decision-making; how storytelling has helped to give voice to oppressed populations over history; how narratives of suffering cultivate popular support for human rights; the role played by storytelling in a trial; and how literature can shed light on the limits of law and public policy.
ENGL6730;;;Standard English and the Question of Literary Aesthetics in African Literature;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;ASRC6730;;;This course will explore the philological debates as engaged in by Samuel Johnson and William Wordsworth in Romantic England, and writers such as Chinua Achebe and Ngugi Wa Thiong'o in colonial and post colonial Africa. The goal is to explore contradictory responses to the fundamental question in African literature: In whose language?
ENGL6766;;;Practicum in Performance Criticism and Dramaturgy;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;ENGL4766;PMA4866;PMA6866;;;The function of the theatre critic is well understood, but the role of the dramaturg remains mysterious in the American theatre. Yet theatre critics and dramaturgs use many of the same research, analytic, and writing skills, and need the same knowledge of history, literature, and culture, to perform their duties effectively. This practicum, designed for advanced undergraduates and graduate students, will allow participants to develop the skills central to these complementary professions. The course will include units on writing effective performance reviews, working with student playwrights on new script development, preparing informational materials for directors, designers and actors, writing program essays and other informational materials for audiences, script preparation for production, and selecting/preparing translations for production. While our focus will be on the theatre, students with interest in applying these skills to film/television/media or dance contexts are welcome.
ENGL6773;;;What is a Humanistic Criticism?;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;This course is structured as an investigation of the roots, parameters, and characteristic features of the modern concept of the humanities. We will be reading several kinds of texts: foundational texts that establish the abiding concerns and methods of the disciplines, exemplary texts that stand as models for scholarly practice, descriptive texts that try to articulate and justify the humanities, and marginal texts that test the boundaries of the humanities. Within the humanities, we will be considering history, literary study, and art history and criticism. We will conclude by considering challenges to the humanities presented by "posthumanism," and by digital technology.
ENGL6785;;;Linguistic Theory and Poetic Structure;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;ENGL2960;LING2285;LING6285;;;Poems are among the most highly structured linguistic objects that human beings produce. While some of the devices used in poetry are arbitrary and purely conventional, most are natural extensions of structural properties inherent in natural language itself. The aim of this course is to reveal the ways in which poetry is structured at every level, from rhyme to metaphor, and to show how certain results of modern linguistics can usefully be applied to the analysis and interpretation of poetry. After introducing some of the basic concepts of modern phonology, syntax and semantics, it will be shown how literary notions such as rhyme, meter, enjambment and metaphor can be formally defined in linguistic terms. These results will then be applied to the analysis of particular poems and shown to yield novel and interesting insights into both their structure and interpretation.
ENGL6850;;;Postcolonial Poetry and the Poetics of Relation;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;COML4290;COML6350;ENGL4840;FREN4350;FREN6350;SPAN4350;SPAN6350;;;What kinds of poetry might be usefully characterized as "postcolonial" and what are the stakes of such a designation? What relation do specific poetic features have to geopolitical, cultural, historical, economic circumstances, and to the condition(s) of what has come to be called the "postcolonial" in particular? With special reference to Edouard Glissant's influential concept of a "poetics of relation," attending as well to our own situatedness as readers-perhaps also, though not necessarily, as writers-of poetry within U.S. (and) academic context(s), this seminar will focus on Caribbean and U.S. poetry as especially fruitful sites for exploring a diversity of approaches to these and related questions concerning postcoloniality, poetry, community, language, culture, and identity.
ENGL6941;;;Twenty-First Century African American Literature;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;ASRC6941;;;This seminar will examine novels, drama, poetry, and theory tied to 21st-century black aesthetics. After the first decade of the 21st century, we can now begin to trace the turns and twists that might define twenty-first century African American literature, visual culture, and performance. We will foreground black satire, black diaspora theory, black queer theory, and the framing of neologisms such as "post-black" and  "post-soul." Our texts may include Michael Thomas' Man Gone Down, Danzy Senna's You are Free, Paul Beatty's Slumberland, Percival Everett's Erasure, Harryette Mullen's Sleeping with the Dictionary, Toni Morrison's A Mercy, Colson Whitehead's Apex Hides the Hurt, Post-Black Plays, Darby English's How to See a Work of Art in Total Darkness, and Kevin Quashie's The Sovereignty of Quiet.
ENGL6965;;;Digital Discourse: Humanities, Art, Theory, Archive;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;COML6932;PMA6965;VISST6965;;;What is the relation of the theory and archival practice of the 'digital turn' to the overall question of the humanities? The course will consider a range of critical pressure points that have been central to the digital humanities and the production of new media art and theory. How have the developments of digital culture and theory impacted the critical commonplaces of archive, analogy, time, sound, motion, network, body, narrative? Does the destabilization of the archive by open source software and accumulative databases alter the conditions of academic research, the space of artistic practice, and the place of ideology critique?  How do recent trends in "media archeology" and "new materiality" correspond to or contrast with the virtuality of "new media" and the theoretical precedents of poststructuralism. In dialogue with critical paradigms that have been fundamental to the discourse of critical theory, from affect and trauma or aesthetics and archive, to colonialism and politics, sexuality and race, we will reflect on the parameters of a deeply significant archeological shift emphasized, if not wholly embodied, by the digital condition.
ENGL6970;;;Cosmopolitanism;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;COML6970;GOVT6779;;;This course will examine cosmopolitanism as a cultural, moral, and political concept both historically, with reference primarily to the eighteenth century, and theoretically, in contemporary debates. The aim will be to elaborate critically the universalist and egalitarian premises of the Enlightenment notion of cosmopolitical subjects and to evaluate what progressive or ideological functions this notion continues to play in discourses on sovereignty, human rights, religious tolerance, and cultural dissemination and aesthetic community. Works by Cicero, Hobbes, Adam Smith, Rousseau, Kant, and Marx will be read with those by Arendt, Balibar, Derrida, Habermas, Honig, and other contemporary theorists.
ENGL6972;;;Derrida In/And Africa;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;ASRC6515;;;From the late-1970s on, the Algerian-born philosopher Jacques Derrida began to be much troubled by his African past. Reading Derrida as an African, reading for the African in Derrida, in, we might say, deconstruction, might find its apogee in Monolingualism, Or, the Prosthesis of the Other, but this course will "trace" the moment of African articulation in Derrida to both earlier moments and other texts, including Specters of Marx, and The Other Heading.
ENGL7412;;;Law and Humanities Colloquium;;;3;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;LAW7412;;;In an era of increasing interdisciplinary collaboration, the fields that comprise the humanities are engaging in new ways with law as well as with each other, and projects developed within the context of law schools themselves bear renewed relevance to the humanities. This colloquium will bring together scholars working at the forefront of legal history, law and literature, law and culture, and critical theory from the institutional vantage points of both law and the humanities. Those who present materials will be asked to speak not only about their specific research but also to address where their work is situated within new developments in law and humanities as a whole. The course will begin with three weeks of seminar designed to apprise students of the history of law and humanities to date and to situate current developments within this history. We will, for example, read classics of the law and literature movement by James Boyd White and Robert Cover, then inquire as to how recent work-such as the essays in Victoria Kahn and Lorna Hutson's collection Rhetoric and Law in Early Modern Europe-might differ in approach. The rest of the course will be organized around a series of speakers, some drawn from Cornell and some from other universities. The students will convene for a half hour at the beginning of the session, which will then be opened to a larger community, including faculty members, for the talk itself. Students will be required to write six three- to five-page papers responding to the speakers' pre-circulated talks; these will be due in advance of the class session and shown to those lecturing in order to prompt and enhance discussion. Everyone who wishes to take the course for credit must attend the first class.

FGSS2760;;;Desire;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;COML2760;ENGL2760;LGBT2760;PMA2680;;;"Language is a skin," the critic Roland Barthes once wrote: "I rub my language against the other. It is as if I had words instead of fingers, or fingers at the tip of my words. My language trembles with desire." Sexual desire has a history, even a literary history, which we will examine through an introductory survey of European dramatic literature from Plato and Aristophanes to Jean Genet and Caryl Churchill, as well as a survey of classic readings in Western sexual theory from the Ancient Greeks through Freud and Foucault to contemporary feminism and queer theory. Topics for discussion will include Greek pederasty, Christian mysticism, hysteria, sadomasochism, pornography, cybersex, and other performative pleasures.
FGSS2780;;;Body as Text: Pleasure and Danger;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;ENGL2780;LGBT2780;;;We experience our bodies as so much a part of who we are that we take them for granted. Yet the way we think about the body has a history of its own. This class looks at how the idea of "the body" gets constructed over time. How has the body come to have attributes called "gender," "sexuality," and "race"? Why have some bodies been seen as monstrous, perverted, and unholy, others as gorgeous, normal, and divine? What makes bodies pleasurable and dangerous? We'll find out by examining a broad range of evidence from the ancient era to the present day, including literature (Ovid, Kafka, Octavia Butler), philosophy (Plato, Descartes, Judith Butler), film, and the history of science.

We will approach theory as a tool for analyzing relations of power and a means of transforming ways of thinking and living. In particular, we will investigate the cultural, social, and historical assumptions that shape the possibilities and problematics of gender and sexuality. Throughout we will attend to specific histories of class, race, ethnicity, culture, nation, religion and sexuality, with an eye to their particular incitements to and challenges for feminist thinking and politics.
FGSS3331;;;Gender and Sexuality in Southeast Asian Cinema;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;ASIAN3331;ASIAN6631;FGSS6331;LGBT3331;LGBT6331;PMA3431;RELST3331;;;Examines the new cinemas of Southeast Asia and their engagement with contemporary discourses of gender and sexuality. It pays special attention to the ways in which sexuality and gendered embodiment are at present linked to citizenship and other forms of belonging and to how the films draw on Buddhist and Islamic traditions of representation and belief. Focusing on globally circulating Southeast Asian films of the past 15 years, the course draws on current writings from feminism, Buddhist studies, affect theory, queer studies, postcolonial theory, and film studies to ask what new understandings of subjectivity might emerge from these cinemas and their political contexts. Films will be drawn from both mainstream and independent cinema and will include the work of directors such as Apichatpong Weerasethakul, Danny and Oxide Pang, Yau Ching, Thunska Pansittivorakul, Garin Nugroho, and Jean-Jacques Annaud.

Course materials include numerous primary sources in addition to scholarship from a variety of disciplines (history, literature, sociology, anthropology).
FGSS3505;;;Blaxploitation Film and Photography;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;AMST3515;ARTH3505;ASRC3505;PMA3505;VISST3505;;;Blaxploitation films of the 1970s are remembered for their gigantic Afros, enormous guns, slammin' soundtracks, sex, drugs, nudity, and violence. Never before or since have so many African American performers been featured in starring roles. Macho male images were projected alongside strong, yet sexually submissive female ones. But how did these images affect the roles that black men and women played on and off the screen and the portrayal of the black body in contemporary society? This interdisciplinary course explores the range of ideas and methods used by critical thinkers in addressing the body in art, film, photography and the media. We will consider how the display of the black body affects how we see and interpret the world by examining the construction of beauty, fashion, hairstyles and gendered images as well as sexuality, violence, race, and hip-hop culture.
FGSS3540;;;Modeling Race, Fashioning Beauty;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;AMST3560;ASRC3550;;;Using written and visual biographies as a starting point, this class follows African and African American women in the fashion industry to explore perceptions of beauty, race, gender and class.

FGSS3550;;;Decadence;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;COML3550;ENGL3550;LGBT3550;;;"My existence is a scandal," Oscar Wilde once wrote, summing up in an epigram the effect of his carefully cultivated style of perversity and paradox. Through their celebration of "art for art's sake" and all that was considered artificial, unnatural, or obscene, the Decadent writers of the late-nineteenth century sought to free the pleasures of beauty, spirituality, and sexual desire from their more conventional ethical moorings. We will focus on the literature of the period, including works by Charles Baudelaire, Edgar Allan Poe, A. C. Swinburne, and especially Oscar Wilde, and we will also consider related developments in aesthetic philosophy, painting, music, theater, architecture, and design.
FGSS3580;;;Theorizing Gender and Race in Asian Histories and Literatures;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ASIAN3388;ASIAN6688;COML3980;COML6680;FGSS6580;;;For a long time area studies have overlooked the questions of gender, race/ethnicity, and social class in fields related to East Asia and the trans-Pacific regions. Little attention has been paid to how to conceptualize gender and race/ethnicity; how to analyze the mutual implication of sexism, racism, and class essentialism (some call it "class racism"), and how to understand the relationships of these topics to the broader contexts of colonialism, imperialism, and nationalism. This course is designed to offer a series of discussions about the following problems: (1) the historically specific modes of sexism and racism in social spaces related to Japan and other places in the trans-Pacific; (2) the mutual implication of sexism, racism, and social class in various contexts including those of colonialism, imperialism, and nationalism; (3) the roles of gender, race, and social class in the United States' knowledge production about East Asia in general; and (4) the conceptions of gender and race in the social formations particular to East Asia. The assigned readings include both English and Japanese materials. However, those who register in ASIAN 3388 are exempt from reading the materials in Japanese.
FGSS3691;;;The Race and Gender of Poverty in Literature and Film;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;AMST3690;ENGL3690;;;Poverty is an ongoing issue in the United States, and has intensified since the recession of 2008.

FGSS4000;;;Senior Seminar in Feminist, Gender, and Sexuality Studies;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;This senior seminar constitutes the culmination of the FGSS major-it provides a unique opportunity to come together with all the other FGSS seniors to both put to use what has been learned and explore new aspects of feminist, gender, and sexuality studies. In this particular seminar, we will attempt to answer, in short, the question of what it means to be a feminist today, at this point in time and place. Pursuing the intersections of theory and practice, we will explore issues and concerns in the areas that you have identified as central to your concept and/or critique of feminism.
FGSS4040;;;Women Artists;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;ARTH4610;;;This seminar examines both feminist art criticism and the work of women artists from antiquity to the present. We consider the works of the most prominent women artists from each period in relation to the changing roles of women in society. The artists covered include Jennifer Barlett, Artemisa Gentileschi, Elizabeth Vigee-Lebrun, Mary Cassatt, Kathe Kollwitz, Georgia O'Keefe, Louise Nevelson, Joan Mitchell, Judy Chicago, and Barbara Kruger.
FGSS4160;;;Gender and Sexuality in Southeast Asia;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ASIAN4416;ASIAN6618;FGSS6160;HIST4160;HIST6160;LGBT4160;LGBT6160;;;Students consider the relationships among colonialism and gender and sexual identity formation in Southeast Asia. Using material from a wide range of fields including anthropology and literature, the course complicates the simplistic East/West and male/female binary. Each year the course is offered, its emphasis shifts to adapt to changes in the fields of gender, sexuality and Asian Studies. It incorporates theoretical literature and content that is broader than that of Southeast Asia.
FGSS4220;;;New York Women;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;STS4221;;;Over the centuries New York State has been the site of activity for a great many women of consequence. This course is a one-semester survey of the past and present activities and contributions of rural and urban women in a variety of fields of interest to Cornell students: politics, medicine, science, the law, education, business (including hotels), entertainment, communications, government, labor, religion, athletics, the arts, and other areas. Weekly readings and discussion and a paper, possibly using local or university archives.
FGSS4270;;;Parody;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;AMST4805;LGBT4270;PMA4805;;;In A Theory of Parody, Linda Hutcheon defines parody broadly as "repetition with critical difference, which marks difference rather than similarity." Taking a cue from Hutcheon, we will consider parody as a form of meaning making that is not necessarily used in the service of ridicule. Rather, we will examine a number of late-twentieth- and early-twenty-first-century imitative works in order to distinguish the rich variety of political agendas and aesthetic rationales for recent parody. An emphasis on postmodern or contemporary performances and media that renovate images, ideas, and icons from modernism and modernity will unite our otherwise diverse efforts. Some of these efforts will also highlight what happens when an artist takes up a work made for one platform (for example, theatre, performance art, installation, cinema, television, the Web) and parodies it in another. Creators and works under consideration may range from Christopher Durang, Split Britches, and Pig Iron Theatre Company to The Simpsons, Cookie's Fortune, and Strindberg and Helium.
FGSS4291;;;Marriage and Divorce in Africa;;;4;;;;;;;;;;;;ASRC4291;HIST4291;;;Marriage was the widely expected norm within African societies. The institution was an important marker of adulthood, linking individuals and lineages in a network of mutual cooperation and support. Marriage practices and the concomitant gender expectations varied significantly between societies, and over time. As a result, marriage and divorce are especially rich terrain for exploring social history, women's agency, discursive constructions of 'women', masculinity and gender relations of power. This course explores some of the newest scholarship on marriage by Africanist scholars. The readings demonstrate the wide cultural variety in marriage as well as the dynamic relationship between marriage and historical change. They especially highlight women's roles and expectations in marriage, masculinity and the ways men and women negotiated the rules and boundaries of marriage.
FGSS4339;;;Bodies at the Border;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ASIAN4440;ASIAN6640;COML4339;COML6339;FGSS6339;LSP4339;LSP6339;;;Although the wounded, often feminine, body is the most powerful way of imagining border space in both the Indian subcontinent and the Americas, it is seldom coupled with the embodied practices and performances through which borders define everyday life and shape geographical and historical consciousness in the two regions. Drawing upon texts, media, and theory generated from South Asia and Latin America, the course will develop new comparative approaches to the constitutive role that bodies play in creating, maintaining, and imagining borders in the global South.
FGSS4402;;;Women in Hip Hop;;;4;;;;;;;;;;;;AMST4402;AMST6402;ANTHR4102;ANTHR7102;ASRC4402;ASRC6402;FGSS6402;LGBT4402;LGBT6402;;;This course will explore how women are portrayed in hip hop music and culture, addressing women both as consumers and producers. We will draw on texts that analyze misogyny in hip hop music and music videos, while also looking at how both mainstream and marginalized female hip hop artists contest sexually exploitative images of women. The course will utilize Black feminist theory, consumption theory, and youth culture theory to help students interpret and critique the ways in which women are represented in hip hop music, art, fashion, and dance, and in its surrounding culture. Considering analyses of African American, Caribbean, Asian-American, South African, and Latino interactions with hip hop, the course will investigate how youth construct gender and ethnic identities as they negotiate notions of African Diasporic belonging vis-a-vis hip hop. We will employ ethnographic, historical, sociological, literary, and interdisciplinary texts to explore questions such as: What do the sexual politics of rap music reveal about broader gender constructions? How can we compare the portrayal of women in hip hop to representations of women in related musical genres?  How are hetero-normative gender ideologies reinforced in hip hop culture? Does hip hop allow a space for alternative femininities? The course will also address broader questions related to representations of Black femininity, minorities in the media, gender and sexual identity construction.
FGSS4403;;;Black Women Writers of the South;;;4;;;;;;;;;;;;ASRC4403;ASRC6403;ENGL4603;FGSS6403;;;This course considers the new generation of writers of black women that has emerged in the U.S. South in more recent years, whose writings have increasingly impacted the development of contemporary African American literature. Genres that we will explore include the novel, poetry and essay and memoir. We will consider a range of authors, including Tayari Jones, Shay Youngblood, Honoree Jeffers, and Natasha Tretheway. Concomitantly, we will explore the visual art of Kara Walker. We will consider ways in which these writers build upon established themes and conventions in African American and black women's writing and the implications of their work for black feminist theory.   Furthermore, we will examine the impact of their work within the emergent field of twenty-first century African American literature and criticism.
FGSS4415;;;Representing Eros: Thailand;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ASIAN4425;ASIAN6625;FGSS6625;LGBT4425;LGBT6625;;;This course investigates the ways in which gender, sexuality, and desire have been thought of, written about, and depicted in Thailand as well as in the global imaginary about the country. While it draws also on historical cases, the course is primarily interested in examining key questions regarding sexuality, embodiment, and desire in the contemporary public sphere in Thailand. Thematic foci include notions of temporality, globalization, liberalism, space, nationalism, policy, and Buddhism. Students are encouraged to use the course to further develop their own research projects.
FGSS4440;;;Historical Issues of Gender and Science;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;STS4441;;;A one-semester survey of women's role in science and engineering from antiquity to the present, with special emphasis on the United States in the 20th century.

FGSS4491;;;Feminism and Philosophy;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(KCM-AS);;;Prerequisite:  one philosophy course or one course in feminist theory (FGSS).;;;PHIL4490;;;Feminist approaches to questions in metaphysics, epistemology, language, and value theory.
FGSS4640;;;Women in the Modern Middle East;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;HIST4642;NES4642;;;The primary emphasis of this discussion seminar is the historical development of gendered identities and the fluid manner in which different Middle Eastern communities responded to shifting ideas of sexuality, reproduction, and the family. Our focus of inquiry will be on themes that involve and relate to women, both directly and indirectly. We will particularly examine how and why women's status differs from one Middle Eastern country or region to another. From both theoretical and topical points of view, we will consider some of the most recent literature about women and gender. Since this is a history course, we will also examine how women's roles, as well as gendered systems and institutions, have changed over time.
FGSS4740;;;Feminism, Post-Feminism, and Cyberfeminism;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ARTH4154;ARTH6154;FGSS6740;VISST4154;;;In this seminar students will investigate the emergence of feminism in art and theory and subsequent reactions of relevant artists and theorists to that movement. These developments will be discussed in relation to the accelerated technological developments of the twentieth century, which affected not only modes of communication and artistic production but also scientific and popular understandings of bodies, and nature. Themes will include sex and gender, nature, representation, pleasure, technology and the body, race, surveillance, pornography and agency. Media covered in the course include painting, performance, installation, video, film, and interactive digital media.
FGSS4801;;;Black Queer Studies;;;4;;;;;;;;;;;;ASRC4800;ASRC6800;FGSS6801;LGBT4800;LGBT6800;;;This course traces the genealogies and animating debates in black queer studies. Attentive to the relationship between black feminist criticism and black queer theory, this class proceeds with an understanding of gender and sexuality as intrinsic to the study of blackness in global contexts. Readings will include essays and books from Audre Lorde, E. Patrick Johnson, Christina Sharpe, Robert Reid Pharr, and others. Students will also engage popcultural texts, such as films, music videos, and novels to address the conjecture of blackness and sexuality in critical and vernacular discourse.
FGSS4876;;;Humanitarian Affects;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;ANTHR4176;GOVT4745;SHUM4876;;;Liberal feminists and political theorists argue that sentiments such as compassion and empathy have the capacity to alert us to suffering, injustice, and oppression, and thus incite transformative political action. This interdisciplinary seminar explores the challenges to this theory by staging a conversation between postcolonial, feminist, and queer theories of affect, and anthropological critiques of humanitarian projects. Sentiments are mobilized to defend borders, wage wars, grant asylum to refugees, provide medical care and disaster relief, and inspire feminist activism. We will analyze how these gendered and racialized ethical projects and political regimes are co-constituted, and how they mediate access to resources and survival, as well as political agency, subjectivity, citizenship, and national belonging.
FGSS4945;;;Body Politics in African Literature and Cinema;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ASRC4995;ASRC6945;COML4945;COML6945;ENGL4741;FGSS6945;LGBT4945;LGBT6945;VISST4945;VISST6945;;;The course examines how postcolonial African writers and filmmakers engage with and revise controversial images of bodies and sexuality-genital cursing, same-sex desire, HIV/AIDS, genital surgeries, etc. Our inquiry also surveys African theorists' troubling of problematic tropes and practices such as the conception in 19th-century racist writings of the colonized as embodiment, the pathologization and hypersexualization of colonized bodies, and the precarious and yet empowering nature of the body and sexuality in the postcolonial African experience. As we focus on African artists and theorists, we also read American and European theorists, including but not certainly limited to Giorgio Agamben, Michel Foucault, Roland Barthes, and Joseph Slaughter, detecting the ways in which discourses around bodies in the African context may shape contemporary theories and vice versa.

FGSS4992;;;Affective Ecologies;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;COML4026;ENGL4992;LGBT4992;SHUM4992;;;This seminar considers the points of intersection between theories of affect, emotion, and sexuality in recent queer and feminist thought, and the set of critical and cultural developments that has come to be called the "nonhuman turn." We will explore contemporary critical attention to the agential, sensory and cognitive capacities of the non-human, considering how this body of work reconfigures the relations between human and nonhuman worlds, and the more flexible and nuanced accounts of "nature" and "environments" that they make possible. At the same time, we will examine how the radically expanded ethos of being-in-common proposed by the non-human turn operates alongside the structures and histories of dehumanization to which and feminist, queer and critical race theory have drawn our attention.
FGSS4994;;;Archiving Sensation;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;COML4027;ENGL4994;LGBT4994;SHUM4994;;;This course will address the 2014-15 Society for Humanities theme of "sensation" through questions of method, focusing in particular on the interdisciplinary challenges of documenting and archiving sensation. Areas of focus will include: theory and practice of the archive from both queer studies and postcolonial studies; intersections of queer theory and affect theory that explore non-normative experiences of sensation, attachment, and intimacy; questions of genre and media, with particular emphasis on the limits and possibilities of "writing" sensation as opposed to representing it in other media, especially experimental and new media practices such as performance and art installation that are more explicitly embodied and/or material.
FGSS6160;;;Gender and Sexuality in Southeast Asia;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;ASIAN4416;ASIAN6618;FGSS4160;HIST4160;HIST6160;LGBT4160;LGBT6160;;;Students consider the relationships among colonialism and gender and sexual identity formation in Southeast Asia.

It pays special attention to the ways in which sexuality and gendered embodiment are at present linked to citizenship and other forms of belonging and to how the films draw on Buddhist and Islamic traditions of representation and belief. Focusing on globally circulating Southeast Asian films of the past 15 years, the course draws on current writings from feminism, Buddhist studies, affect theory, queer studies, postcolonial theory, and film studies to ask what new understandings of subjectivity might emerge from these cinemas and their political contexts. Films will be drawn from both mainstream and independent cinema and will include the work of directors such as Apichatpong Weerasethakul, Danny and Oxide Pang, Yau Ching, Thunska Pansittivorakul, Garin Nugroho, and Jean-Jacques Annaud.
FGSS6339;;;Bodies at the Border;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;ASIAN4440;ASIAN6640;COML4339;COML6339;FGSS4339;LSP4339;LSP6339;;;Although the wounded, often feminine, body is the most powerful way of imagining border space in both the Indian subcontinent and the Americas, it is seldom coupled with the embodied practices and performances through which borders define everyday life and shape geographical and historical consciousness in the two regions.

FGSS6472;;;The Problem with Rights;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;AMST6472;COML6472;GOVT6776;HIST6472;LGBT6472;;;In June 2013, in the space of a week, the Supreme Court ruled on affirmative action, the legacy of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, and the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). While the first two decisions were perceived as a step back in the fight against racial discrimination, the repeal of DOMA was welcomed by mainstream LGBT-rights organizations as a decisive move towards equality. One of the goals of this seminar is to think these rulings together instead of treating them as separate entities. How did the struggle for sexual rights and the promotion of color blindness come to coexist so easily within the law? In order to understand how liberalism has operated historically and theoretically as a crucial site of regulation for sexuality and race, we will read texts from a wide range of contexts and disciplines including political theory, anthropology, literature, philosophy, history, and law. Readings will include "classic" critics of liberalism such as Marx, Nietzsche, Althusser, and Foucault, and contemporary authors such as Wendy Brown, Elizabeth Povinelli, Lisa Duggan, David Eng, Janet Halley, Katherine Franke, and Jasbir Puar, among others.

Little attention has been paid to how to conceptualize gender and race/ethnicity; how to analyze the mutual implication of sexism, racism, and class essentialism (some call it "class racism"), and how to understand the relationships of these topics to the broader contexts of colonialism, imperialism, and nationalism. This course is designed to offer a series of discussions about the following problems: (1) the historically specific modes of sexism and racism in social spaces related to Japan and other places in the trans-Pacific; (2) the mutual implication of sexism, racism, and social class in various contexts including those of colonialism, imperialism, and nationalism; (3) the roles of gender, race, and social class in the United States' knowledge production about East Asia in general; and (4) the conceptions of gender and race in the social formations particular to East Asia.

Compositions on student-selected topics and a detailed grammar review aid in reaching the goals.  Themes and emphases may vary from section to section.
FREN2310;;;Introduction to French and Francophone Culture;;;4;;;Fall, spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;Prerequisite: FREN 2190 or CASE Q++.;;;;;;This course, designed to follow FREN 2190, introduces students to an array of literary and visual material from the French and Francophone world.  It aims to develop students' proficiency in critical writing and thinking, as well as presenting students with the vocabulary and tools of literary and visual analysis.  Each section of FREN 2310 will have a different focus-for example, colonialism and the other, or the importance of women and sexual minorities in French and Francophone history, performance in literature and film, or image and narrative-but all sections of FREN 2310 will emphasize through writing assignments and in-class discussions, the development of those linguistic and conceptual tools necessary for cultural and critical fluency.
FREN2400;;;Cultures of the Middle Ages;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;MEDVL2400;;;This course introduces students to one of the major concerns of the literature, art, and religious thought of western Europe between roughly 400 and 1400 AD: transformation. We'll begin with Ovid and Apuleius, the classical and late-classical myth-makers who literally wrote the books on metamorphosis. We'll then look at Augustine's  Confessions - where Christian conversion  becomes an even more startling kind of transformation - before proceeding to the stories of shape-shifters gathered together by the twelfth-century French poet Marie de France.  Then we'll take a look at Dante's account of metamorphosis as retribution in Inferno, as well as the kinds of transformations fantasized in the margins of medieval manuscripts, as Michael Camille describes them in Image on the Edge. We'll finally take the time to engage with both the transfiguration of Christ in medieval thought and its close analogue, stigmatization, as undergone most famously by Francis of Assisi. In the process, we'll ask what happens when the human is transformed into the divine.
FREN3010;;;Advanced French Composition and Conversation;;;4;;;Fall, spring.;;;;;;Prerequisite: FREN 2190 or CASE Q++.;;;;;;In this course, furthering oral communication skills and writing skills is emphasized.  A comprehensive review of fundamental and advanced grammatical structures is integrated with short stories, literary excerpts, videos, poems, and articles from French magazines or newspapers, all chosen for thematic or cultural interest.  Students write weekly papers (essays and translations), have daily conversations focusing on the topics at hand, and give at least one presentation in class.
FREN3050;;;Advanced French through Film;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;Prerequisite: FREN 2190 or CASE Q++.;;;;;;This language course provides students with opportunities to further develop their written and oral communication, as well as their listening and reading skills, through the use of French contemporary films, related readings, and presentations by guest speakers. Particular emphasis is given to the cultural and historical context within viewed films, as it relates to contemporary French society.
FREN3120;;;French Stylistics;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;Prerequisite: FREN 3010 or FREN 3050, or CASE Q++.;;;;;;This course on stylistics, and its application to textual analysis and translation, aims to help students develop a richer, more nuanced and idiomatic command of both the spoken and written language. Systematic study of grammar is discontinued as more attention is devoted to such topics as descriptive stylistics, authorial style, varieties of spoken French and their literary representations, rhetorical figures and poetics, as well as textual analysis and translation theory. Writing exercises include: literary pastiche, isosyntactic imitation, intralingual translation, an exercice de style, stylistic analysis, and critical translation. Additional exercises will target vocabulary development and contrastive grammar. Seminar-style participation in class discussions is expected.
FREN3130;;;Advanced French through News;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;Prerequisite: FREN 3010 or FREN 3050, or placement by CASE, or permission of instructor.;;;;;;This course prepares students for interacting at an advanced level of proficiency in both speaking and writing. Students will increase their vocabulary and knowledge of idiomatic French, while discussing and debating topics of current interest as they are presented in French televised news broadcasts and other media. A flexible approach allows students to improve their language skills on an individualized basis.
FREN3400;;;French Identities: 21st Century Culture and Society in France;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;Prerequisite: FREN 2310 or CASE Q++, or permission of instructor.;;;;;;This course is conceived as a critical introduction to a cultural and political debate that appeared in the years of Mitterrand's France and reached its climax in the last decade.  It will focus on a French society deeply shaped by immigration and globalization.  In which way do the youth of the "banlieue" - mostly formed by postcolonial Blacks and Muslims - create their own culture with the French culture?  How have literature, essays, movies, documentary films, "national identity" carried on by governments reacted to these transformations?  Selecting literary texts (by Maryse Conde, Zahia Rahmani, Adb El Malik) and other cultural productions, the course will explore the new expressions of France as an "imagined community".
FREN3430;;;Francophone Travel Literature;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;Prerequisite: FREN 2310 or CASE Q++.;;;;;;If traveling and travel journals are not a new phenomenon, their popularity has considerably increased, and travel literature has taken new forms with the development of new technologies such as travel blogs. Since when do people travel and write about their travels?  What do they write about their journeys, and for whom?  What is at stake in such literature?  This course is an "Invitation to the Voyage" (Baudelaire) in all of its forms (including initiation trips, road trips, business trips, exploration trips, leisure trips, spiritual journeys or journeys without purpose) and to the exploration of its literary implications.  Through readings of travel journals and fictions based on journeys, this course questions the relationships between traveling and writing.  It will trace back travel literature from the 16th century (J. Cartier) to recent publications (S. Tesson), via the generation of "Bourlingueurs" at the end of the 19th century (Cendrars, Segalen).  Alongside this "journey" through centuries of Francophone literature, a particular attention will be given to the 18th century (Bougainville, Montesquieu, Voltaire) and, in the 19th century, to the birth of orientalism.  In the 20th century, the course will question more particularly the relationships between travels and migrations.  Alongside the literary material, the course will also cover a large variety of media (blogs, essays, movies, songs, paintings and photography in particular) in order to study the extent to which literature contributes to the experience of traveling, as well as how travel influences writing practices.
FREN3470;;;The Figure of the Outsider in French Cinema;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;This course will trace the changing character of the outsider in French cinema from early realist film to the present day. In opposition to the dominant bourgeois ideals of economic security and social homogeneity, in these films the outsider emerges as someone who cannot, or will not, play by the rules. We will begin with the satirical critiques of bourgeois life through the figure of the bumbling ingrate in the films of Renoir and Tati, then exploring the nouvelle vague of the 1960s and 1970s, its outsiders excapsulating the disenchantments of the post-war generation: Godard's existential gangster, Varda's wandering actress, Truffaut's menage a trois, Resnais's disturbed Algerian veteran, and Chabrol's disloyal wife. Next, we will address the figure of the immigrant outsider, who does not chose to be separate but rather has exclusion thrust upon them, in Yamina Benguigui's documentary Memoires d'immigres and Abdellatif Kechiche's La Graine et le mulet. Finally, we will look at the violence of social exclusion and the volatile and threatening outsiders it seems to produce, figures who linger menacingly on the edges of a comfortable bourgeois world: Mathieu Kassovitz's La Haine, Michael Haneke's Cache and Jacques Audiard's Un prophete. Along the way, we will get to know the way the genres, techniquess and cinematic personalities that have shaped Fench cinema as we know it today.
FREN3490;;;Literature and Moral Complexity;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;COML3531;ITAL3490;ROMS3490;;;In this course, we will ask how literature helps us to formulate ethical questions, i.e., question for which there is no single, objectively correct answer.  Why literature as opposed to philosophy or history?  Numerous aspects of literture make it ideal for taking on complex ethical questions.  Literture can be used to persuade or even manipulate; it appeals to our emotions as well as our reason, and may even call into question the neat division between the two; it forges sympathies that tie us as readers to characters and narrators, even as we suspect their motives.  For most of our time together, we will focus on great writers and storytellers of early modern Europe (e.g., Boccaccio, Machiavelli, Montaigne, Marguerite de Navarre, Bandello), but we will also explore how ethical questions posed by these early modern writers continue to surface in the work of an author like Barbey D'Aurevilly and in a contemporary movie such as Stephen Spielberg's Lincoln. If there is student interest, we will offer discussion sections in French and Italian.
FREN3540;;;On Paying Attention;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;RELST3540;;;In the age of smartphones and Facebook, the competing claims made on our attention only seem to be multiplying. This course is an opportunity to think about and to enact certain practices of attentiveness and concentration, drawing largely from religious, literary, artistic, philosophical and anthropological sources. We'll be trying various kinds of exercises - from reading poems and looking at paintings to eating more slowly - as we read about the ways in which our seneses reach out to the world, and as we think together about how technology may be used in ways that are not, strictly speaking, technological. This course is for students at all levels, from all backgrounds, graduate and undergraduate, with the  understanding that we all need an excuse to slow down and observe the world - and ourselves - a little more carefully.
FREN3620;;;Culture of the Later Renaissance;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ARTH3420;COML3620;RELST3620;ROMS3620;;;This course explores networks of culture and power that develop over the course of the sixteenth century, from the beginning of the Reformation to the Wars of Religion that swept through the continent.  We will examine this period through the lenses of several disciplines: history, history of science, art history, literature, music.  Guest lecturers will include professors from all of these fields, and authors and artists to be studied will include: Luther, Marguerite de Navarre, Michelangelo, Ambroise Pare, Shakespeare, and Monteverdi.
FREN3730;;;Religious Violence in France and Francophone Texts;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;Prerequisites: FREN 2210 or FREN 2310, FREN 3010, FREN 3050, or CASE++ placement, or permission of instructor.;;;;;;This course will examine the various forms religious violence takes on: war, massacre, pillage, and torture - and consider the symbolic meanings invested in these forms of violence in the context of the work of Rene Girard (La Violence et le sacre).  We will raise the question of what makes this sort of violence so intractable, and what has fostered the continuity of religious conflict over such a long span of time.  For exampe, the ceremonial or ritualistic nature of this violence seems to give it an internal justification that is not subject to laws concerning human rights.  Then, we will examine how a range of authors throughout history represent this violence in critical fashion.  A number of texts present the impossibilty of representing extreme violence, raising the question of how events can be witnessed when the witnesses are dead or traumatized by them.  How can such extreme violence be represented or explained without being justified or rationalized?  We will examine how the presentation of violence as a spectacle raises the questions of personal responsibility in the context of large scale and ongoing violence, implicating also those who observe but who do not directly participate.  We will also consider Maalouf's Les Croisades vues par les arabes (as well as his Identites meurtries), Joinville's La Vie de Saint Louis, Theodore Agrippa d'Aubigne's Les Tragiques, Elie Wiesel's La Nuit, Gillo Pontecorvo's La Bataille d'Algers, Jean Genet's Les Paravents, Shoshana Felman and Dori Laub's Testimony, and Elaine Scarry's The Body in Pain.
FREN3870;;;Romanticism in French;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;Prerequisite: FREN 2210 or FREN 2310, or permission of instructor.;;;;;;This course offers an introduction to Romanticism, as it develops in France and beyod, from the late 18th century to the early 1860s.  While the focus will be on literture, we will also consider other arts (especially painting and architecture) and see how the Romantic movement was also proposing a whole renovation of life, affecting the way nature, social relationships, or love could be experienced.  Because Romanticism was a "global" phenomenon, we will pay attention to the role played by voyages, exploration, and the circulation of ideas.  Studied authors will include major writers (such as Chateaubriand, Mme de Stael, Musset, Nerval, Hugo, or Bauldelaire) and less famous figures, including Francophone authors from the Americas (Haiti or Louisiana, in particular).
FREN4155;;;Reimagining the Body in North African Literature, Film and Visual Culture;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;FREN6155;;;In this course we will encounter, imagine and re-imagine lots of different bodies and bodily experiences with writers, artists and filmmakers in Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco who have resisted bodily oppression through their work. We will feel, alongside Franz Fanon in Peau noire, masques blanches, the dislocation between the mind and the body experienced by the colonized subject. We will consider women's veiling and unveiling during the Algerian War of Independence, and its political idealization by male writers and filmmakers, for example in Pontecorvo's La Bataille d'Alger. Next we will gaze at the harem bodies of Western fantasy, looking at how contemporary artists and writers question the violence implicit in works like Delacroix's Femmes d'Alger dans leur appartment. Through the films of Nadir Makneche and Djamila Sharoui, we will journey alongside the body in road trips, expeditions for missing people and escape plots to the other side of the Mediterranean. Finally, we will spend some time with marginal figures who capture some of the tragicomic nature of their bodily restrictions: with homosexual bodies and bodies for sale in the bars, brothels and nightclubs of Algiers and Tunis; with a girl raised as a boy in Marrakech; and with an ex-Nazi who shows up in a remote Algerian village.
FREN4180;;;Poetry and Mind;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;COML4226;COML6226;FREN6180;;;This interdisciplinary seminar would like to offer new hypotheses on the ways poetry is understood and experienced by a reader's mind. Our methodology, while non-reductionist, will take into account the current state of cognitive science, and also build on literary theory and philosophy (both "analytic" and "Continental"). Poetry makes use of cognitive structures and paths, of formal repetitions and algorithms-but it also alters and challenges the usual boundaries of thought. Thus, we need to consider both the ordinary and the extraordinary, if we ever want to explain the mental performance of the poetic. A comparative corpus of poems (written in European languages, from Antiquity to the 20th century) will be used throughout the semester. Students from very diverse backgrounds but with an interest in mind and/or language and poetry are welcome.

FREN4340;;;Wandering Souls, Women and Ghosts:Mediumship Between Emancipation and Psychiatry;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;FREN6340;;;Merging the methodologies of cultural history, religious anthropology and psychology, this seminar will analyze the presence of ghosts in the scientific discourse, cultural practices and literature of nineteenth century France. Stories of wandering souls, haunted houses and medium narratives shape the field of the emerging psychiatry and a literature fascinated by strangeness. Revisiting the dogma of Purgatory, the Church tries to re-conquer its lost place in a secularized society, whereas-inspired by mostly female mediums-Alan Kardec creates a spirit doctrine based on the cult of the dead and the rejection of hell. In the background, there is a world mourning the dead of revolutions, wars and epidemics.
FREN4350;;;Postcolonial Poetry and the Poetics of Relation;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;COML4290;COML6350;ENGL4840;ENGL6850;FREN6350;SPAN4350;SPAN6350;;;What kinds of poetry might be usefully characterized as "postcolonial" and what are the stakes of such a designation? How common, variable, translatable are values deemed "postcolonial" for particular poetics across cultures? Is there such a thing as a transnational, transcultural, "Postcolonial Poetics?" What relation(s) do specific textual/poetic features or strategies have to geopolitical, cultural, historical, economic circumstances, and to the condition(s) of what has come to be called the "postcolonial" in particular? With special reference to Edouard Glissant's influential concept of a "poetics of relation," attending as well to our own situatedness as readers-perhaps also, though not necessarily, as writers-of poetry within U.S. (and) academic context(s), this seminar will focus on Caribbean poetry as an especially fruitful site for exploring a diversity of approaches to these and related questions concerning postcoloniality, poetry, community, language, culture, and identity.
FREN4370;;;Detours of Desire;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;;;;This course will examine some of the major texts of the French canon (principally but not exclusively 19th century) to analyze the role of "desire" in its various forms in some of the most noteworthy novels in the French tradition.  We will examine the different theories of "desire" as elaborated in the works of de Rougemont, Freud, Lacan, etc. to try to understand how different authors use (often unbeknownst to them) the socio-sexual constraints of their time to destabilize those very constraints and by so doing opening up potentially new paradigms for individual expressions of passion.

It is during those years, nevertheless, that the destruction of European Jews aroused an intellectual debate whose philosophical, political, and literary contributions constitute landmarks for contemporary culture and criticism.  The course will explore the reasons for such a discrepancy, reconstructing the steps of the integration of the Holocaust into our historical consciousness.  It will analyze some of the most significant attempts to think such a trauma made by German-Jewish exiles (Arendt, Adorno, Anders), the survivors of the Nazi camps (Amery, Levi, Celan, Antelme), as well as the public intellectuals on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean (Sartre, Bataille, MacDonald, etc).

Its ideas, debates and controversies could be viewed-historicized and revisited-in a different light.  The defeated revolutions of the past century put into question a teleological vision of history, engendering the decline of Marxist historiography and the simultaneous appearance of memory, a previously ignored concept for interpreting the past.  Outlining a symbolic shift from Marx to Benjamin, this change has a melancholic flavor that permeates many expressions of contemporary Left culture (from movies and autobiographies to historical and philosophical essays).  On the other hand, the emergence of Postcolonialism reopened the debate on the Eurocentric roots of Marx's thought and stimulated a new approach to some classical Marxist thinkers and historians such as Gramsci and C.L.R. James.  Taking into account both classical and contemporary texts, the seminar will analyze a reconfigured relationship between history and memory in the Left culture of our post-utopian age.
FREN4680;;;Theater in Seventeenth-Century France: Theaters of the Self;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;FREN6680;;;This course examines the work of the three greatest playwrights of the 17th century (Corneile, Moliere, Racine). We will attempt to answer the questions: Why was theater the privileged form of representation of the 17th century? What is the relation between political Absolutism and the theater? And finally why was this theater essentially a representation of familial conflict? In other words, why and how does the theater of the 17th century participate in the evolution of the "modern" subject, its socio-sexual constructions and its ideological elaboration?
FREN4770;;;Contemporary Arts and Literature in France;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;;;;This class focuses on artistic and literary creation in France, from the 1980s to the present.  We will consider pop or rap songs, novels, bande dessinee, theater plays, movies, paintings, sculptures, photographs, and maybe even fashion, cuisine or TV series.  Roughly half of our time will be devoted to literature.  We will explore topics such as the limits of fiction, the construction of the self, the creation of new forms, the links between the arts and politics, or the postcolonial.

FREN6280;;;Perversions of the Linguistic Turn: Figure, Fetish, Formalization;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;COML6782;;;A number of influential thinkers have contested in recent years the so-called "linguistic turn" in twentieth century thought, and in particular the assumption that the "finitude" or decompletion of language dooms to failure any attempt to construct or transmit the objects of thought and experience.  If the "finitist" view is often identified with the structuralism of Jacques Lacan or with Jacques Derrida's influential account of the "supplement" (a tropological understanding of language as founded upon lack and substitution), recent critics of finitude have turned to practices like mathematical formalization (Badiou, Meillassoux) or to such concepts as "desiring machines" (Deleuze and Guattari), the "figural" (Lyotard), the "event" (Badiou), "plasticity" (Malabou) or "ancestrality" (Meillassoux) to elaborate approaches to the construction or transmission of an object that are characterized either as extra-linguistic or as modalities of language not conditioned by lack or substitution, which pretend to "write the real" rather than to re-present it tropologically in the mode of repression or negation.  We will focus our attention on three linguistic modes that purport to straddle the alleged gap between language and its "real": figure, fetish, and formalization.  In addition to the authors mentioned above, readings will include selections from Quintillian,Paul, Auerbach, Foucault, and Perniola, as well as literary works by Sade, Sacher-Masoch, Lautreamont, Mallarme, Gide.
FREN6290;;;Revolutions/Gender/Fictions;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;While literary histories have for a long time undervalued women's works in the literary canon, it has been also common to continue to hold the belief that, with the passing of time, women have progressively entered the Academy of French Letters.  The "feminist" generations of the 1980's celebrated the entry of women into modern literature but also contested the idea of linear progress when it came to women.  This seminar will approach the question of the relationship between women, literature and the 'progress' of history in a counter-intuitive fashion.  Contesting, after Joan Kelly, the historical linearity of progress for 'women,' we will analyze pertinent cases in three literary moments (the Renaissance, the Classical age, the Revolutionary era).  The goal of the course is to scrutinize how femininity and masculinity are concurrently and constantly reenacted according to the evolution of economical, social, religious and political paradigms.  We will more specifically identify, during the 'longue duree' period of the Old Regime, moments of crisis when women held a prominent role in literary production.  Authors read will include Marguetire de Navarre, Mme de Lafayette, Mme de Stael and George Sand.

GERST4100;;;Senior Seminar: Writing in/from Exile;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;Prerequisite: any German course at the 3000-level or equivalent or permission of instructor.;;;;;;'Literature of the Exile', written between 1933 and 1945 by authors who had fled Germany (e.g., Seghers, Brecht, Thomas and Heinrich Mann, Feuchtwanger, Zweig, Lasker-Schuler), provided most of the enduring works of this time period. But how is writing even possible when writers are cut off precisely from the audience they want to reach? How did authors manage the publication and distribution of their works (e.g., venues for publication, use of other media, political organization)? What topics and problems are addressed (e.g., failure of the 'German-Jewish symbiosis,' alienation, memory, im/possibility of hope)? What reasons spoke for or against a return (and to which Germany)? What did the encounter between returning authors and those who had stayed in Germany ('inner emigration') look like? The course will also address writing in exile as a historical phenomenon, reaching from Ovid and Dante to the early works of Herta Muller.
GERST4165;;;In the Vein of Kafka;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;COML4165;;;The course begins with the banal observation of Franz Kafka's pervasive influence on many, many later writers. The more important beginning, though, is the understanding that we will be done with Kafka when we are done with bureaucracy, anxiety, exhaustion, family tragicomedy, interpretation, bad air, ambiguous sexuality, religious befuddlement, written and unwritten law, and dreams. Visiting Prague, the Chinese poet Bei Dao relates that his host "took us to Kafka's home beside the square of the Old Town, and pointed out that beneath our feet flowed a huge vein of ore." Reading Kafka and others-Robert Walser, Roberto Arlt, Bruno Schulz, W. G. Sebald, James Kelman, Can Xue, Yoko Tawada-we will mine that ore.
GERST4231;;;Perspectives in Intellectual History: Modernity, Cataclysm and the Jews (1880-1930);;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;GERST6231;HIST4232;HIST6232;JWST4230;JWST6230;ROMS4230;ROMS6230;;;Between the end of the nineteenth century and the second World War, the Jewish intellectual appears as a new figure of European societies, quickly becoming a major actor in public spheres.  During those years, the Jewish intellectual becomes a privileged object of investigations, definitions and fantasies -- including anti-Semitic stereotypes -- for literature and popular culture, sociology and medicine or law, deeply shaping national mentalities and imagination.  A considerable iconography, from painting to political propaganda and illustrated magazines, sketches his real or invented profile.  As an incarnation of urbanity, mobility, extraterritoriality, textuality and rational thought, the Jewish intellectual turns out to be a mirror of modernity, eliciting a strong conservative rejection.  Lasting from the Dreyfus Affair to the Nazi burning of books in 1933, and focusing on three national contexts -- France, Germany and Italy -- the course tries to explore the history of this collective representation through its multiple expressions, both textual and visual.
GERST4260;;;The Animal;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;COML4240;ENGL4260;GOVT4279;;;In recent years literary representations and philosophical discussions of the status of the animal vis-a-vis the human have abounded. In this course, we will track the literary phenomenology of animality. In addition we will read philosophical texts that deal with the questions of animal rights and of the metaphysical implications of the "animal." Readings may include, among others, Agamben, Aristotle, Berger, the Bible, Calvino, Coetzee, Darwin, Derrida, Descartes, Donhauser, Gorey, Haraway, Hegel, Heidegger, Herzog, Kafka, Kant, La Mettrie, de Mandeville, Montaigne, Nietzsche, Ozeki, Rilke, Schopenhauer, Singer, Sorabji, Sterchi, Stevens, de Waal, Wittgenstein, Wolfe. A reading knowledge of German and French would be helpful.

It is during those years, nevertheless, that the destruction of European Jews aroused an intellectual debate whose philosophical, political, and literary contributions constitute landmarks for contemporary culture and criticism.  The course will explore the reasons for such a discrepancy, reconstructing the steps of the integration of the Holocaust into our historical consciousness.  It will analyze some of the most significant attempts to think such a trauma made by German-Jewish exiles (Arendt, Adorno, Anders), the survivors of the Nazi camps (Amery, Levi, Celan, Antelme), as well as the public intellectuals on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean (Sartre, Bataille, MacDonald, etc).

Yet since World War II, his influence, his reputation, and his fascination for scholars in a wide range of cultural and political disciplines has steadily grown. He is seen as a bridging figure between German and Jewish studies, between materialist critique of culture and the submerged yet powerful voice of theology, between literary history and philosophy. We will review Benjamin's life and some of the key disputes over his heritage; read some of the best-known of his essays; and devote significant time to his enigmatic and enormously rich masterwork, the Arcades Project, concluding with consideration of the relevance of Benjamin's insights for cultural and political dilemmas today.

Its ideas, debates and controversies could be viewed-historicized and revisited-in a different light.  The defeated revolutions of the past century put into question a teleological vision of history, engendering the decline of Marxist historiography and the simultaneous appearance of memory, a previously ignored concept for interpreting the past.  Outlining a symbolic shift from Marx to Benjamin, this change has a melancholic flavor that permeates many expressions of contemporary Left culture (from movies and autobiographies to historical and philosophical essays).  On the other hand, the emergence of Postcolonialism reopened the debate on the Eurocentric roots of Marx's thought and stimulated a new approach to some classical Marxist thinkers and historians such as Gramsci and C.L.R. James.  Taking into account both classical and contemporary texts, the seminar will analyze a reconfigured relationship between history and memory in the Left culture of our post-utopian age.

GERST4996;;;Perfection, Objectivity and Sensation in Philosophy of Art;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;CLASS4604;PHIL4596;SHUM4996;VISST4996;;;A graduate level discussion of the role of sensation in philosophy of art, and its relation to conceptions of objectivity and perfection. We'll aim to transform our understanding of a range of issues raised within traditional philosophy of art (for example, in the work of Plato, Aristotle, Aquinas, Hume, Kant, Nietzsche and Heidegger) by drawing upon relevant contemporary approaches in metaphysics, theory of knowledge and philosophy of mind.
GERST6050;;;Classicism: Goethe and Schiller;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;This seminar examines Goethe's and Schiller's literature and thought through the question: What is Classicism? How does it differ in style, principle, content and form from both what came before (e.g. Sturm &amp; Drang) and after (e.g. Romanticism). The course will thus cover the entire Goethe-Age, with its fulcrum being the unique friendship and literary-critical output of Goethe and Schiller during a little more than a decade (1794-1806). Poetry, drama, and prose (literary and critical) of both authors will be the focus of attention. The seminar will conclude with a look at the aftermath of Classicism: both Romanticism and Goethe's own late, post-Classical style.
GERST6090;;;Poetologies after 1945;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;Since the 1950s, many of the important poetological reflections by German-speaking authors were produced in the context of lectures upon receiving prizes, at universities or simply in the public sphere.  This course examines 1) changing notions of the author as public intellectual or media figure and the ongoing and evolving relationship between author and society; 2) the intertextual web between these programmatic statements in terms of problems of language; questions of representation, fictionality and documentation; the politics of poetry and prose after 1945; subjectivity and history.  Authors include Gottfried Benn, Paul Celan, Theodor W. Adorno, Ingeborg Bachmann, Hubert Fichte, Christa Wolf, Martin Walser, Durs Grunbein, Rainald Goetz, Ulrich Peltzer, Kathrin Roggla, W. G. Sebald, Feridun Zaimoglu/Ilja Trojanow, Juli Zeh, Ann Cotten.
GERST6100;;;Marx and Marxisms;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;COML6631;GOVT6706;SPAN6100;;;The terms "Marx" and "Marxisms" have meant different things to different people, beginning with Marx himself and continuing in his legacy today.  As obviously, this legacy remains global (Europe, North and Latin America, India and Pakistan, Vietnam, Africa, Near East and Far East)--all still including imagined allies, neutrals, and foes.  This seminar is an approach to this otherwise bewildering complexity: we focus on two things: (1) a possible Marxist (or Communist or Anarchist) theory of all language and any semiotics; alongside (2) its equally possible inter-action with manuals of guerrilla warfare.

GERST6400;;;The Modern German Novel;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;The goal of this seminar is to analyze selected works of modernist fiction in order to assess the stylistic qualities that constitute their specifically modernist character. Concentrating on novels ranging from the late 19th to the early 20th century, we will pay close attention to questions of narrative structure as well as temporal and spatial arrangements. Also including comparatist interests, the seminar will discuss the modern German novel within the European context; discuss generic differences (modern versus "classic"); examine theories of the novel and their relationship to contemporary representational concerns. Specific points of interest are: the status of self-reflection; philosophical interruptions; irony; montage; subjectivity and literary self-projection; literature and urbanity.  In order to evaluate the "very" modern, the class will also discuss two examples of contemporary fiction. Authors include: Rilke, Kafka, Doblin, Broch, Th. Mann, R. Walser, Nossack, Handke, Johnson, Bernhard, Goetz, Musil, Beckett.

GERST6510;;;Contemporary Aesthetic Theory and its Discontents;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;ARTH6510;COML6370;VISST6500;;;After having been reduced to a mere ideological formation of bourgeois origin, aesthetics has recently made a strong comeback in the field of theory. This course probes the reasons for this historical change. From the arguments of the critics we will derive a catalogue of criteria for a viable aesthetics in order to examine how contemporary aesthetic theory relates to cognitive theories, the historicity of art and taste (including specific practices and institutions), and the emancipatory potentials of ethics and politics. Readings may include Adorno, Berger, de Bolla, Bourdieu, Noel Carroll, Cavell, Danto, Derrida, Dickie, Eagleton, Goodman, Guillory, Gumbrecht, Halsall, Luhmann, Lyotard, de Man, Walter Benn Michaels, Obrist, Ohmann, Scarry, Seel, Shustermann, Barbara Herrnstein Smith, Williams and others.

Taking leave of a sociological model that interprets this literature as a plea for compassionate intercultural dialogue, this course juxtaposes prose fiction about cultural contact and critical theories of difference with two primary goals in mind. Students will be introduced to representative examples of contemporary German literatures of migration, and critical modes of conceptualizing cultural contact in Germany will be compared in relation to each other and in tension with the literary field. A focus on German literature of Turkish migration will be complemented by readings reflecting other transnational phenomena such as postsocialism, postcolonialism, and globalization.

GOVT1111;;;Introduction to American Government and Politics;;;4;;;Fall, summer.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;;;;A policy-centered approach to the study of government in the American experience.  Considers the American Founding and how it influenced the structure of government;  how national institutions operate in shaping law and public policy; who has a voice in American politics and why some are more influential than others; and how existing public policies themselves influence social, economic, and political power.  Students will gain an introductory knowledge of the founding principles and structure of American government, political institutions, political processes, political behavior, and public policy.
GOVT1313;;;Introduction to Comparative Government and Politics;;;4;;;Spring, summer.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;;;;This course will introduce students to comparative politics-the study of the political institutions, identities, and organized interests in countries around the world. Emphasis is on how to make meaningful comparisons between systems in different countries. Towards that goal, we will be looking at a dozen countries with different histories, political systems, and from various regions around the world. We will also use a comparative framework to use our knowledge of these (and other) countries to examine questions about democracies and democratization, electoral systems and political parties, authoritarian regimes, political mobilization and change, economic development and globalization, nationalism and identity politics, among other topics. The meta theme of this course is the comparative method as a unique way of leveraging our understanding about social and political phenomena.
GOVT1503;;;An Introduction to Africana Studies: Blackness in Global and Transnational Perspective;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;AMST1500;ASRC1500;;;At the inception of this department at Cornell University in 1969, the ASRC became the birthplace of Africana studies and is now an institution increasingly defining the "new Africana studies." Africana studies is a discipline that has been increasingly universalized in academia and that emphasizes comparative and interdisciplinary studies of Africa, the U.S., the Caribbean and other diasporas.  In this course, we will look at the diverse contours of the discipline and draw on resources from the humanities and social sciences. We will explore contexts ranging from modernity and the Trans-Atlantic slave trade and plantation complex in the New World to processes of decolonization and globalization. Within this framework, we will also consider the concept of race and notions of racial formation and newer concepts such as "post-blackness." We will consider how blackness as a concept shapes cultural flows and exchanges in the global context and saliently impacts popular culture. Topics that we will explore include history, literature, music, art, education, politics, religion, economics, health and the prison industrial complex.
GOVT1615;;;Introduction to Political Philosophy;;;4;;;Winter, spring, summer.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;;;;A survey of the development of Western political theory from Plato to the present.

GOVT2002;;;Creating Contemporary Cornell;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;AMST2003;HIST2501;;;Creating Contemporary Cornell will examine the history of Cornell from 1945-Present. Using a multi-disciplinary approach, the course will address the bureaucratization, politicization, and globalization of Cornell and the end of in loco parentis in the context of World War II, the Cold War, the civil rights movement, Vietnam, and the emergence of China.
GOVT2225;;;Controversies About Inequality;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;DSOC2220;ILROB2220;PAM2220;PHIL1950;SOC2220;;;In recent years, poverty and inequality have become increasingly common topics of public debate, as academics, journalists, and politicians attempt to come to terms with growing income inequality, with the increasing visibility of inter-country differences in wealth and income, and with the persistence of racial, ethnic, and gender stratification. This course introduces students to ongoing social scientific debates about the sources and consequences of inequality, as well as the types of public policy that might appropriately be pursued to reduce (or increase) inequality. These topics will be addressed in related unites, some of which include guest lectures by faculty from other universities (funded by the Center for the Study of Inequality). Each unit culminates with a highly spirited class discussion and debate.
GOVT2503;;;Africa from Partition to the Postcolonial State;;;4;;;;;;;;;;;;ASRC2506;;;The title of this survey course refers to three specific moments in the history of Africa: the partition of Berlin (1884), the advent of neo-colonialism as independence (1960); and the post-structural adjustment 'failure' of the postcolonial state. It centers around The Congo, which stands as the symbol of this African crisis of modernity both as the geographic heart of Africa, one subject to imperial geopolitical games, and also the symbol of the 'darkness' that Africa has become to its foreign protectors, trustees, and mandatory powers, other interventionists - states and non-state entities alike.
GOVT2583;;;Environmental Issues in the Contemporary Middle East;;;3;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;BSOC2681;JWST2687;NES2687;;;Centrally located between two continents; the Middle East is drawn by nature to many environmental challenges that are re-lated to its unequal distribution of natural resources associated with its geological setting, mosaic ethnic composition, and cultural diversity. Such environmental background sets the need for an essential understanding of challenges that faces the area and is likely fundamental to its survival. In this course, we will assess environmental issues facing the current Middle East including but not limited to i. population exponential growth, ii. water scarcity, iii. natural resources distribution, iv. en-vironmental hazards associated with conflict, and v. tourism to provide future recommendations for environmental man-agement that focuses mainly on youth involvement i.e. the concerned generation.
GOVT2604;;;Obama and the Meaning of Race;;;3;;;;;;;;;;;;ASRC2504;SOC2520;;;The election of Barack Obama to the presidency has raised new questions in the American debate on race, politics, and social science. Has America entered a post-racial society in which racism and inequality are things of the past? Or does Obama's post-Black, race-neutral approach to governing signal the end of Black politics, race-based activism and prescriptive policy? In this course, students will use the Obama presidency to think, talk, and write about how race works in America. We'll examine the symbolism of Obama's personal narrative and biracialism to analyze his race-neutral campaigns and governing within the context of history, politics, and policies. We'll look at the public image of Michelle Obama, especially how she is gendered as Black radical and fashionista.
GOVT2605;;;Social and Political Philosophy;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(KCM-AS);;;;;;PHIL2420;;;This course will examine key issues in social and political philosophy. Topics may include the legitimacy of the state, political obligation, the nature and demands of justice, equality, liberty, and autonomy. Selected readings may be drawn from historical as well as contemporary sources.
GOVT2716;;;Politics of Violence in Twentieth Century Europe;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;HIST2711;JWST2711;;;This course provides a survey of Europe's 20th-century history with special emphasis on violence and its interpretation. Types of violence to be considered include warfare, terrorism, genocide, uprisings, and assassination, among others. Discussions of the First and Second World Wars and the political and ethnic clashes of the Cold War and decolonization will be supplemented by less familiar instances of violence in the European context. Lectures, readings and written assignments will focus on deciphering the various political motivations behind calls for and interpretations of violence.
GOVT2747;;;History of the Modern Middle East: Nineteenth to Twentieth Centuries;;;3;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;ASRC2674;HIST2674;JWST2674;NES2674;;;This course examines major trends in the evolution of the Middle East in the modern era. Focusing on the 19th and 20th centuries and ending with the  "Arab Spring," we will consider Middle East history with an emphasis on five themes: imperialism, nationalism, modernization, Islam, and revolution.  Readings will be supplemented with translated primary sources, which will form the backbone of class discussions.
GOVT2935;;;Equality, Liberty, and Democracy;;;4;;;;;;;;;;;;PHIL1930;SOC2930;;;An interdisciplinary discussion of economic inequality, civil, political and economic liberty and democracy. Some specific questions that we will consider are: In what ways and to what extent are Americans economically unequal? What are the major causes of American inequality and poverty? To what extent should inequality and poverty be changed by political means?  How should governments deal with religious diversity and other differences in ultimate values, which give rise, for example, to radically different attitudes toward abortion, sexuality, and the preservation of unspoiled nature?  Moral argument, empirical findings and theories of social causes interact in the search for answers to these questions. Our readings will derive from many disciplines and areas of public life, including political philosophy, sociology, economics, and political science.
GOVT3001;;;Constitutional Law;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;;;;Constitutional Law provides the setting for some of the most contentious disputes in American life. Decisions by the Supreme Court about the meaning of the Constitution can change the country in dramatic ways.  But to think of Constitutional Law as simply a body of rules misses at least half the picture.  Supreme Court decisions are also enormously potent symbols, wielded like weapons in contests about what it means to be an American.  People who have never read Brown v Board of Education or Roe v Wade still think these decisions matter a great deal, even if they cannot tell you exactly what they say.  This course will examine Constitutional Law both as a body of rules and a contested symbol in American life.
GOVT3002;;;Civil Rights and Civil Liberties;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;;;;This course presents an overview of the law regarding civil rights and civil liberties. But the law is only part of our focus. Rights do not spring into existence simply because a judge pounded a gavel or a president signed a bill. The rights and liberties we take for granted have been the subject of violent and bitter contests that go to the very meaning of national identity. To study the law of civil rights and civil liberties in this country is to study not just a collection of cases and statutes, but a history of endless struggle and eternally unfulfilled promise about what it means to be an American.
GOVT3012;;;The Politics of Poverty in the U.S.;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;;;;Poverty is a phenomenon of enduring importance with significant implications for democratic governance. This course explores contemporary poverty in America, with a particular emphasis on its political causes and consequences. What is the proper role of government in addressing poverty? Under what conditions are the poor able to gain power despite their relative lack of privilege? What is the relationship between race and poverty? How do notions of "culture" shape conceptualizations of the poor? We will tackle these questions by drawing on insights from seminal texts in political science and sociology, supplemented with journalistic accounts of poverty.
GOVT3112;;;Congress and the Legislative Process;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;The course will be a lecture course on Congress, introducing them to the political science literature on the topic and the major research questions and approaches. We will examine the development of the institution, including formal theories for congressional organization as well as historically and politically oriented accounts of rule changes, committee power, and party influence. We will also look at the determinants of legislative productivity and gridlock, approaches to measuring and analyzing congressional behavior, the changing role of the electoral connection, and the causes and consequences of polarization. 
GOVT3131;;;The Nature, Functions, and Limits of Law;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;AMST3131;LAW4131;;;A general-education course to acquaint students with how our legal system pursues the goals of society. The course introduces students to various perspectives on the nature of law, what functions it ought to serve in society, and what it can and cannot accomplish. The course proceeds in the belief that such matters constitute a valuable and necessary part of a general education, not only for pre-law students but especially for students in other fields. Assigned readings comprise legal materials and also secondary sources on the legal process and the role of law in society. The classes include discussion and debate about current legal and social issues, including equality, safety, the environment, punishment, and autonomy.
GOVT3142;;;Incarceration, Policy Response, and Self-Reflection;;;3-4;;;Spring.;;;(SBA-AS);;;Prerequisite: Participation as a Teaching Assistant in the CPEP program in Auburn or Cayuga or work in a juvenile or other correctional facility.;;;AMST3142;;;This class is intended to provoke some hard thinking about the relationship of committed "outsiders" and advocates of change to the experience of crime, punishment, and incarceration and to the men we meet at Auburn/Cayuga who have been in most instances long-confined to prison. We will read, think, talk and write about the incarceration experience and about policies that shape this experience. We will also think self-reflexively about the character of the 'outsider's' educational, political, and personal engagement.   What are the motivations and what are the goals of such engagement? What are the anticipated outcomes - personal, social, educational, political, and/or moral and perhaps spiritual? In an effort to delve deeply into these questions, we will read a broad selection of work on incarceration, itself, as well as on the experience of what has come to be termed service learning or civic engagement.
GOVT3189;;;Taking America's Pulse: Creating and Conducting a National Opinion Poll;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;COMM3189;;;In this course, students will design, conduct, and analyze a national-level public opinion survey. Students will determine all survey questions based on their research interests. There are no prerequisites, as students will learn all necessary survey research skills in the class.
GOVT3264;;;National Security in the Middle East;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;NES3864;;;National security in general and the security sector (the military and the other security services) in particular, are critical factors when attempting to comprehend both recent and past developments in the Middle East, including, most recently, the events of the "Arab Spring" and its aftermath. In this course, we will discuss the different political, economic, social and cultural roles played by the military and the security sector, but also by more informal "security networks," and, occasionally, by violent sub-state non-state actors (VISNAS) and violent trans-national non-state actors (VITNAS), in the Middle East as a subcategory of the non-Western regions. In the first part of the course, we will discuss some of the main areas where the impact of the security sector, of informal "security networks," and of VISNAS and/or VITNAS can be discerned: the process of state formation and its various facets; the relationship between the civilian and security spheres; and inter-communal relations. We will then zoom in on several illustrative case studies from the Middle East, including Israel, Lebanon, Iraq and Syria.
GOVT3281;;;Constitutional Politics: The U.S. Supreme Court;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;AMST3281;LAW3281;;;This course investigates the United States Supreme Court and its role in politics and government. It traces the development of constitutional doctrine, the growth of the Court's institutional power, and the Court's interaction with Congress, the president, and society. Discussed are major constitutional law decisions, their political contexts, and the social and behavioral factors that affect judges, justices, and federal court jurisprudence.
GOVT3293;;;Comparative Politics of Latin America;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;DSOC3290;LATA3290;;;This course is designed as an introduction to political, economic, and social issues in 20th-century Latin America. Topics are organized chronologically, beginning with the process of industrialization and incorporation of the popular sectors in the 1930s and 1940s, and ending with the recent rise of the left to power in the region. Among the main issues covered are populism and corporatism, dependency theory and import-substitution industrialization, revolutions, the breakdown of democracy, military rule, democratic transitions, debt crisis and market reforms, social movements, and migration. Throughout the semester, we will draw on examples from the entire region, but the course will focus on six main countries, namely Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Peru, Mexico, and Venezuela. Knowledge of Spanish or Portuguese is not required.
GOVT3303;;;Politics of the Global North;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;ILRIC4330;;;From a perspective based on comparative political economy, this course examines pressing contemporary issues such as the politics of growing inequality.  We consider conflicts around markets, democracy, economic and social justice, including the efforts of actors such as governments nd labor unions aimed at economic recovery, reducing inequality, and the reform of national and global economic policy and institutions.  We also look at distinctive types of political and economic organization, especially in Europe and the United States, and the capacities of these societies to meet current economic, political, and social challenges, both domestic and internationl.
GOVT3403;;;China Under Revolution and Reform;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;ASIAN3321;CAPS3403;;;This course provides a broad overview of the evolution of Chinese politics from the early part of the 20th century to the present. It is roughly divided into two sections. The first traces the formation and the progression of modern state and party institutions following the collapse of the Qing Dynasty in 1911, through the communist rise to power and into the Mao era (1949-1976), culminating in the period of "opening up and reform" (1978-present). The second part of the course examines China's institutional apparatus, focusing on mapping out the government, Party, and military bureaucracies; examining relations between Beijing and the localities; and on the institutionalization of these structures and processes over time. No prior knowledge of China is required or expected.
GOVT3494;;;Special Topics in Regional Development and Globalization;;;4;;;;;;;;;;;;AMST3854;CRP3854;;;
GOVT3553;;;Issues Behind the News;;;2;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;This course will cover international current events as they unfold during the semester. Faculty from across the university will be invited to contextualize and deepen students' understanding of elections, wars, complex humanitarian emergencies, international agreements, global health issues, and other relevant international events that are in the news. The course will respond flexibly to unforeseen events. Special attention will be devoted to U.S. foreign policy issues and how U.S. foreign policies are formulated and implemented. The course will strive to expose students to different points of view on these issues.
GOVT3606;;;Homo Oeconomicus;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;COML3542;GERST3610;;;This course examines the economic forces at work in defining and configuring the modern subject, from Adam Smith through Marx and Nietzsche, Simmel and Weber, up to the current neoliberal subject.  The course will investigate figures (as both tropes and subjects) of the human conceived according to three economic paradigms: exchange, debt, and interest. The course will focus on both literary and theoretical sources, including examinations of guiding metaphors (the invisible hand, Schuld as both debt and guilt); the intersection of religious and secular economies; pacts with the devil; economies of salvation/redemption; figures of money/value.
GOVT3625;;;Modern Political Philosophy;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(KCM-AS);;;;;;PHIL3460;;;This course will primarily focus on studying and scrutinizing general conceptions of justice. Topics explored typically include liberty,economic equality, democracy, community, the general welfare, and toleration. We will also look at implications for particular political controversies such as abortion, welfare programs and pornography.
GOVT3646;;;The History of the Present;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;HIST3343;;;According to the philosopher Michel Foucault, we cannot understand what is going on "today" without undertaking a historical excavation of how the current universe of thought, discourse, and culture came about. This course seeks to put into practice Foucault's incentive to construct a "history of the present" by exploring some of the most important ideas that have shaped our present. Among other topics we will discuss authoritarianism, liberalism, constitutionalism, republicanism, Marxism, conservatism, fascism, terrorism, neoliberalism, colonialism, modernism, racism, human rights, feminism, and third-worldism. We will examine how these systems of thought originated, how they came to operate as mechanisms of power and knowledge, and how they presented certain categories and claims as natural, self-evident, or inevitable. Readings will include Hobbes, Rousseau, Madison, Burke, Tocqueville, Robespierre, Arendt, Marx, Hayek, Fanon, Beauvoir, Wittig, and Althusser. Lectures will be organized around the contextualization and the close readings of texts.
GOVT3665;;;American Political Thought from Madison to Malcolm X;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;AMST3665;HIST3160;;;A survey of American political thought from the Eighteenth Century to the present. Particular attention will be devoted to the persistence of liberal individualism in the American tradition. Politicians, pamphleteers and poets will provide the reading. The professor offers insightful historical and social context.
GOVT3675;;;Democracy and its Discontents;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;;;;A historical introduction to democratic theory through the writings of its greatest thinkers and their critics. Beginning with the political thought of democratic Athens and then moving up to the American democratic experiment and contemporary democratic theory, we will explore the promise and peril of democracy considered as a regime, a culture, and an ideology. Authors to be studied may include Thucydides, Plato, Aristotle, Rousseau, the Federalists, de Tocqueville, Mill, Dewey, Arendt. and Habermas.
GOVT3705;;;Political Theory and Cinema;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;COML3300;GERST3550;PMA3490;;;An introduction (without prerequisites) to fundamental problems of current political theory, filmmaking, and film analysis, along with their interrelationship.  Particular emphasis on comparing and contrasting European and alternative cinema with Hollywood in terms of post-Marxist, psychoanalytic, postmodernist, and postcolonial types of interpretation.  Filmmakers/theorists might include: David Cronenberg, Michael Curtiz, Kathryn Bigelow, Gilles Deleuze, Rainer Fassbinder, John Ford, Jean-Luc Godard, Marleen Gorris, Werner Herzog, Alfred Hitchcock, Allen &amp; Albert Hughes, Stanley Kubrick, Fredric Jameson, Chris Marker, Pier-Paolo Pasolini, Gillo Pontecorvo, Robert Ray, Martin Scorsese, Ridley Scott, Oliver Stone, George Romero, Steven Shaviro, Kidlat Tahimik, Maurizio Viano, Slavoj Zizek.  Although this is a lecture course, there will be ample time for class discussions.
GOVT3766;;;Multicultural Israel;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;JWST3767;NES3767;SOC3760;;;In the media we read about conflict in Iraq between Sunnis, Shiites, and Kurds; strife between Muslims and Copts in Egypt; rebellion in Syria against the ruling Alawite minority; and violence between Israelis and Palestinians; and the list goes on. This course aims to enrich students' understanding of the diversity of Middle Eastern countries, exploring histories of inter-communal contact and conflict. In commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of World War I, we will begin our exploration by reflecting on the legacy of the Ottoman Empire and the impact of its dissolution. We will focus our attention on commercial centers that fostered inter-communal relations, as well as investigating sites of strife and cases of minority repression. We will read histories, memoirs, and fiction, and view films that help us better understand inter-communal relations, tensions, and conflict. We will also interrogate the terms for exploring a range distinctions among majority and minority populations including: religious difference (Muslims, Christians, and Jews); divisions of religious rite (Sunni and Shiite); entho-linguistic minorities (Armenians and Kurds); national identities (Israelis and Palestinians); cultures of origin (Mizrahi, Sephardi, and Ashkenazi Jews).
GOVT3877;;;Nuclear Security in a Changing World;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;;;;This course addresses contemporary issues of nuclear security. While it reflects on the past, it focuses on the present and future: what are the current proliferation challenges? What are the threats of nuclear terrorism? Why do states develop nuclear weapons and what types of negotiation strategies can prevent nuclearization?  Have recent efforts to expand the nonproliferation regime been successful and if not, why not? The goal of the course will be to understand where nuclear security issues stand in a post-Cold War context and where they are going.  Towards this end, the course will employ innovative approaches to the study of nuclear security: real-world simulations, social media, and spatial analysis.
GOVT3897;;;Human Rights at War;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;;;;The 20th century witnessed some of the world's most destructive wars and human-rights atrocities - most of them connected to war and conflict. This course examines the impact of war on human rights and the impact of human-rights law and activism on war. It addresses such topics as genocide and "ethnic cleansing," the role of international law, just-war theory, transnational peace activism, humanitarian interventions, environmental and resource-related sources of conflict, nonviolent movements for social change, terrorism and counterterrorism. The readings feature approaches from a range of disciplines, including political science, history, ethics, law, anthropology, political ecology, and gender studies. Course work consists mainly of reading, lectures, discussion (in lectures and in sections), and regular writing assignments.
GOVT3927;;;Understanding Israeli-Lebanese Relations;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;NES3927;;;Since the establishment of the State of Israel and the First Arab-Israeli War in 1948, Israeli-Lebanese relations have known periods of stability and conflict. The course will explain the changing relationship between the two states focusing on their particular characteristics. More specifically, we will examine the process of state formation, pattern of inter-sectoral relations, and civil-security relations in Lebanon and Israel; compare the two states according to these criteria; and then explore the impact of these factors on the two states' changing relationship. The course will include four parts. First, we will discuss the process of state formation, inter-sectoral relations, and civil-security relationship in the Middle East. Second, we will focus on each of the two states--Lebanon and Israel--and identify their particular characteristics. Third, we will compare Israel and Lebanon according to these criteria, but also attempt to situate the two cases in a broad, theoretical and comparative perspective. Fourth, we will examine the major developments in Israeli-Lebanese relations. In addition to promoting a better understanding of Lebanon, Israel, and their relations, the course will provide tools for studying other patterns of Israeli-Arab (and non-Arab) relations.
GOVT3988;;;Democracy, Dictatorships & US Foreign Policy;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(SBA-AS);;;Prerequisite: An introductory course in comparative politics or international relations.;;;;;;What drives U.S. foreign policy-American values, interests or both? Can we draw a clear distinction between support of democracies versus dictatorships during and after the Cold War?  This course uses a series of historical and contemporary case studies, such as U.S. policies towards Iran, Guatemala, South Korea, Egypt and Eastern Europe, in order to answer these questions.
GOVT4000;;;Major Seminar;;;4;;;Fall, spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;Fall Topic: World War I and International Relations Theory.  No war has more prominently featured in political scientists' investigations of armed conflict than the First World War. From Waltz to Mearsheimer and beyond, many scholars have used insights from World War I to develop theories, and have tested theories against evidence from the case. Given this level of attention, there are surprisingly few settled answers to questions about what happened between 1914 and 1918. Did Germany seek war in 1914? What would have happened if Franz Ferdinand had not been assassinated? What was the role of the Schlieffen Plan? Why did the United States intervene? This course investigates these questions and more, and along the way seeks insight about competing theoretical perspectives on questions about the causes, conduct, and termination of war more generally. (S. Ward)
GOVT4019;;;Introductory Probability and Applied Statistics;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;GOVT6019;;;The goal of this course is to introduce probability and statistics as fundamental building blocks for quantitative political analysis, with regression modeling as a focal application. We will begin with a brief survey of probability theory, types of measurements, and descriptive statistics. The bulk of the course then addresses inferential statistics, covering in detail sampling, methods for estimating unknown quantities, and methods for evaluating competing hypotheses. We will see how to formally assess estimators, and some basic principles that help to ensure optimality. Along the way, we will introduce the use of regression models to specify social scientific hypotheses, and employ our expanding repertoire of statistical concepts to understand and interpret estimates based on our data. Weekly lab exercises require students to deploy the methods both 'by hand' so they can grasp the basic mathematics, and by computer to meet the conceptual demands of non-trivial examples and prepare for independent research. Some time will be spent reviewing algebra, calculus, and elementary logic, as well as introducing computer statistical packages.
GOVT4021;;;American Conservative Thought;;;4;;;Fall, spring.;;;(KCM-AS);;;;;;AMST4021;;;American conservative thought rests on assumptions that are strikingly different from those made by mainstream American liberals.  However, conservative thinkers are themselves committed to principles that are both quite varied and sometimes contradictory.  This course examines the assumptions upon which rest the libertarian, market/economic, and cultural/traditional strains of American conservatism and asks whether the tensions between them weaken or strengthen conservative thought as an alternative to mainstream liberalism.
GOVT4092;;;Persuasive Politics;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;;;;Persuasion is inherent in politics. In this course students will learn about the conditions under which persuasion occurs and does not occur in political settings, and the implications for political outcomes such as public opinion and political participation. The principles we discuss will apply to all venues of political communication and debate, including campaigns, policy debates, etc
GOVT4112;;;The Politics of Change;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;AMST4112;;;President Barack Obama was elected in 2008 amid hopes of his supporters that the United States would address numerous pressing domestic policy issues. In this course, we assess Obama's first term, examining why he accomplished his goals in some areas and not in others. We will also analyze the course that reforms took, and why alternative pathways were not pursued. Our inquiry will immerse us in the study of the institutional arrangements of American politics, the current political context, the challenges and opportunities posed by existing policies, and the legacy of past efforts to address key issues. In the first few weeks of the semester, students will learn about the relationship between the White House and Capitol Hill and the rise of partisan polarization in Congress. The body of the course will focus on prominent issue areas, such as: taxes and inequality, health care, higher education, K-12 education, and the environment. In each case, we will examine the issue in historical perspective by analyzing past reform efforts, and we will consider the Obama administration's record to date and consider the implications for success over the next few years. Students will have the opportunity to write in-depth research papers.
GOVT4218;;;History of the United States Senate;;;4;;;Fall, spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;AMST4218;HIST4030;;;This course will offer students an opportunity to view the process of shaping national debates from the perspective of the United States Senate. The modern Senate will serve as the point of reference for an inquiry into the development of the institution's powers under the Constitution during the past 200 years. Class readings, lectures and discussions will focus on the themes of continuity and change, the role of individual senators, and the institutional evolution of the Senate. In addition to general class reading and written examinations, each student will write a short paper and participate in an oral presentation.
GOVT4232;;;The Politics of the Inner City;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;This course will examine the actors, institutions and processes that shape political life in urban areas. With a particular focus on poverty, we will assess the political roots and implications of the problems facing disadvantaged residents of the urban metropolis. Drawing on a diverse array of readings in political science and sociology, this course will bring an empirical and intellectual perspective to bear on salient and sometimes controversial topics that pervade public discourse about the "inner city." Special emphasis will be placed on policies related to race, education, immigration, crime, gangs, gentrification, neighborhood context and homelessness.
GOVT4279;;;The Animal;;;4;;;;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;COML4240;ENGL4260;GERST4260;;;In recent years literary representations and philosophical discussions of the status of the animal vis-a-vis the human have abounded. In this course, we will track the literary phenomenology of animality. In addition we will read philosophical texts that deal with the questions of animal rights and of the metaphysical implications of the "animal." Readings may include, among others, Agamben, Aristotle, Berger, the Bible, Calvino, Coetzee, Darwin, Derrida, Descartes, Donhauser, Gorey, Haraway, Hegel, Heidegger, Herzog, Kafka, Kant, La Mettrie, de Mandeville, Montaigne, Nietzsche, Ozeki, Rilke, Schopenhauer, Singer, Sorabji, Sterchi, Stevens, de Waal, Wittgenstein, Wolfe. A reading knowledge of German and French would be helpful.
GOVT4291;;;Politics of Science;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;BSOC4291;STS4291;;;This course examines scientific controversies that become political. Why does some science become politicized rather than normalized and routinized? How do societies deal with collective uncertainty and risk entailed in authoritative scientific findings? How do social movements respond to niches in contentious knowledge to expand influence? To what extent is science made politically vulnerable by its commitment to incremental evidence-based knowledge in contention with junk science? What do interest-based explanations of politics tell us and leave out? An archetypal case is climate change, but it is one of many. Topics range broadly and will be adjusted to student interests.
GOVT4303;;;The GMO Debate: Science and Society;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;BIOPL4303;BSOC4303;CSS4303;IARD4303;PLBR4303;STS4303;;;Biotechnology is a broad term for the tools used to alter living organisms for human purposes. Genetic engineering (recombinant DNA technology) is one class of methods used in biotechnology. Private sector firms are actively marketing transgenic crops and other products of biotechnology globally. The public sector has been somewhat less active, but is becoming increasingly involved in transgenic technologies, particularly in less-industrialized countries. Developmental questions begin with those we ask of all technology: at whose cost, to whose benefit? Social movements have arisen to block both the testing and commercializing of biotechnology products, arguing that the developmental consequences are negative. Their objections center on the issues of food sovereignty, effects of land use change on the environment, ownership of transgenic traits and the genetic background in which they are placed (intellectual property), environmental uncertainties/risks, control of the food supply by multinational corporations and human health issues. Students will evaluate the legitimacy of various arguments and political positions relative to scientific findings and cultural norms. They will seek to understand the dimensions of political contention: what is at stake? Why does the controversy reach global dimensions? What are the concrete interests involved?
GOVT4353;;;The Political Development of Western Europe;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;;;;This is a senior seminar on the political development of Western Europe. Students will examine the following questions: what explains the formation of the modern nation-state in Western Europe? What explains the long run economic growth of Europe? How did democracy as we know it now come to Western Europe? What explains the rise of political cleavages and different party systems? Why did countries in Western Europe adopt different patterns of labor relations and forms of redistribution? Students will learn approaches to address the above questions, and will gain and hone analytical skills that can be applied to historical questions as well as contemporary comparative issues. Preference given to senior and junior government majors.
GOVT4403;;;War and the State in Comparative Perspective;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;;;;The goal of the course is to introduce students to the study of the nexus between violence and the creation of the modern state. It is intended to familiarize students with the role that war and other forms of violence have played in shaping the state in comparative perspective. Relying on the emergence of the modern state in Western Europe as a point of departure, the course studies the processes of state formation and state building in Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East.
GOVT4554;;;Beyond Totalitarianism: Politics and Everyday Life in (Post) Socialism;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ANTHR4055;ANTHR7055;GOVT6554;;;This seminar explores cultural, social and political transformations in the (post)socialist world through the methods and analytics of socio-cultural anthropology. Students will learn about the contradictions and paradoxes of socialist ideology and practice, and the enclosures and possibilities produced by socialism's fall. By combining theoretical readings, memoirs, ethnographic texts and films about the socialist period, "Beyond Totalitarianism" will foreground the domain of everyday life as the place where the nation-state, collective memory and political subjectivity become reconfigured in powerful and imaginative ways. While purposefully unraveling Cold War epistemologies, the seminar posits postsocialism as a framework and a critical standpoint from which to interrogate the problem of political will, which has been central to liberal conceptualizations of individual freedom and political agency.
GOVT4578;;;Critical Race Theory;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;AMST4587;AMST6587;ASRC4587;ASRC6587;GOVT6578;;;A political theory seminar that deals primarily with the conceptual and normative questions pertaining to racism and racial identity in the United States context.  Although the precise reading list will vary from year to year, the major figures and commentators may include W.E.B. Du Bois; Frederick Douglass; Booker T. Washington; Ida B. Wells; Charles Hamilton Houston; Thurgood Marshall; Hortense Spillers; Cornel West; Michael Dawson; Robin Kelley; Robert Gooding-Williams; Tommie Shelby; Cristina Beltran; Gary Okihiro; Gerald Torres; Rogers Smith; and Aziz Rana. The theme for 2015 will be African-American political thought and the "Long Civil Rights Movement." Ideally, students will have some background in African American studies and/or American political thought. Strong preference will be given to seniors and graduate students.
GOVT4585;;;American Political Thought;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;AMST4585;;;This seminar will provide a survey of the history of American political thought, with emphasis placed on four significant periods: Puritan New England, the Revolution and Founding, Abolition and Civil War, and the Progressive Era.  Authors read may include: Winthrop, Hutchinson, Franklin, Paine, Jefferson, Madison, Warren, Tocqueville, Fitzhugh, Calhoun, Douglas, Garrison, Thoreau, Melville, Whitman, Lincoln, Adams, DuBois, Goldman, Dewey, Lippmann, Taylor, and Bourne.
GOVT4655;;;Topics in Social and Political Philosophy;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(KCM-AS);;;;;;AMST4655;AMST6656;GOVT6656;PHIL4470;PHIL6430;SOC4430;SOC6430;;;Topic: Equality Efforts to reduce inequality are central to the pursuit of justice. We will investigate leading philosophical controversies about the moral basis of these efforts. To what extent, in what ways and why should the economic inequalities that arise in modern market societies be reduced? At what point does the use of government to reduce economic inequality unjustly conflict with liberty? How should the ideal of political equality be understood? For example, is it fundamentally important that citizens' political influence be approximately equal? What do the values underlying demands for political equality imply about relationships in the workplace? Do duties to reduce economic and political inequality among fellow-citizens properly extend worldwide?
GOVT4666;;;Sense and Citizenship: Aesthetics in Political Theory;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;COML4025;SHUM4990;;;In this seminar, we will inquire into how questions of sensation cross between literature, aesthetics and political theory. Drawing from writings in continental philosophy and phenomenology, the challenge of the class will be to inquire into how sensation in particular broadens notions of citizenship and politics. How do accounts of sensation in political theory reconceive citizenship? What are possible conceptual practices for unraveling normative, colonial, and authoritarian definitions of the political subject? What is the place of sensation in theories of relationality? Students will also be asked to critique the terms under which citizenship is constrained, defined, and regulated. In addition, the course will examine how accounts of sensation delineate traces and figures excluded from the rights conferred by organized polities. In order to account for those excluded from citizenship, the seminar will also consider the role of sight, touch, and imagination in the public realm or, as Hannah Arendt writes, "namely, the faculty of seeing things not only from one's own perspective but from that of all others who are present." Facing the challenge of Arendt's words, the course will reflect on the implications of critique, judgment, and phenomenology for democratic theory in general. Discussions may, for example, seek to uncouple the rhetoric of sovereignty and law from citizenship. Finally, we will ask what a study of sensation provides for redressing and/or accounting for dispossession. As students will be encouraged to integrate their research interests with course reading, topics may include questions of how philosophies of anarchism, civil disobedience, feminism, queer theory, and decolonization broaden ideas of citizenship and political ethics.
GOVT4696;;;Melancholy Left:Marx to Benjamin;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;COML4416;COML6416;FREN4435;FREN6435;GERST4431;GERST6431;GOVT6696;HIST4234;HIST6234;ROMS4430;ROMS6430;;;The fall of "real socialism" in 1990 put an end to the experience of twentieth century Marxism.  Its ideas, debates and controversies could be viewed-historicized and revisited-in a different light.  The defeated revolutions of the past century put into question a teleological vision of history, engendering the decline of Marxist historiography and the simultaneous appearance of memory, a previously ignored concept for interpreting the past.  Outlining a symbolic shift from Marx to Benjamin, this change has a melancholic flavor that permeates many expressions of contemporary Left culture (from movies and autobiographies to historical and philosophical essays).  On the other hand, the emergence of Postcolonialism reopened the debate on the Eurocentric roots of Marx's thought and stimulated a new approach to some classical Marxist thinkers and historians such as Gramsci and C.L.R. James.  Taking into account both classical and contemporary texts, the seminar will analyze a reconfigured relationship between history and memory in the Left culture of our post-utopian age.
GOVT4745;;;Humanitarian Affects;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;ANTHR4176;FGSS4876;SHUM4876;;;Liberal feminists and political theorists argue that sentiments such as compassion and empathy have the capacity to alert us to suffering, injustice, and oppression, and thus incite transformative political action. This interdisciplinary seminar explores the challenges to this theory by staging a conversation between postcolonial, feminist, and queer theories of affect, and anthropological critiques of humanitarian projects. Sentiments are mobilized to defend borders, wage wars, grant asylum to refugees, provide medical care and disaster relief, and inspire feminist activism. We will analyze how these gendered and racialized ethical projects and political regimes are co-constituted, and how they mediate access to resources and survival, as well as political agency, subjectivity, citizenship, and national belonging.
GOVT4786;;;The Holocaust in Postwar Culture (1945-1961);;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;COML4415;COML6415;FREN4415;FREN6415;GERST4411;GERST6411;GOVT6786;HIST4233;HIST6233;JWST4410;JWST6415;ROMS4410;ROMS6410;;;There is an astonishing discrepancy between our perception of the Holocaust as a central event of the twentieth century and its marginal place in postwar culture.  It is during those years, nevertheless, that the destruction of European Jews aroused an intellectual debate whose philosophical, political, and literary contributions constitute landmarks for contemporary culture and criticism.  The course will explore the reasons for such a discrepancy, reconstructing the steps of the integration of the Holocaust into our historical consciousness.  It will analyze some of the most significant attempts to think such a trauma made by German-Jewish exiles (Arendt, Adorno, Anders), the survivors of the Nazi camps (Amery, Levi, Celan, Antelme), as well as the public intellectuals on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean (Sartre, Bataille, MacDonald, etc).
GOVT4805;;;Race & Racism/Law & Society;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;AMST4800;AMST6800;ASRC4805;ASRC6805;GOVT6805;;;A seminar that examines contemporary dilemmas in the construction of race and ethnicity in law, and the racialized construction of social problems and governmentality. We will examine classics in the field and new works, including those by Gerald Torres and Lani Guinier, Dorothy Roberts, Michelle Alexander, Jack Balkin, Derrick Bell, Osagie Obasojie, and the famous legal studies anthologies on critical race theory and law and society edited by Richard Delgado and Jean Stenfancic; and Kimberle Crenshaw, Neil Gotanda, Gary Peller, and Kendall Thomas. The issues that we will explore include: mass incarceration; the history and meaning of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; the social construction of race and ethnicity; the intractable character and historicity of white domination; and the history of black "cause lawyering."  Strong preference will be given to graduate students, law students, and undergraduates with previous coursework in the field.
GOVT4807;;;Social Studies of Space, Technologies and Borders;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;DSOC4301;STS4301;;;In this course we will discuss how society, culture and politics shape technological artifacts and the natural and built environment, such as bridges, roads, and landscapes in diverse cultural contexts. We will examine reasons for the rise in bordering mechanisms - ranging from walls, barriers to fences within cities as well as along national borders, in such countries such as Ireland, Korea, Germany, the US, and Israel. We will compare how such 'strategies of exclusion' impact local communities, transnational relations and social connectivity across such divides. We will also examine how the growth of gated communities has reconfigured urban spaces and given rise to new forms of spatial and social segregation.
GOVT4819;;;Human Rights and Governments;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;;;;Human rights pressures on governments come from many directions. We will explore their conceptual foundations and tensions among them by investigating national human rights practices worldwide in relation to international and regional covenants (like the Geneva Conventions, the American Convention on Human Rights, the African [Banjul] Charter); international and regional bodies (like the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, the European Court of Human Rights); independent governmental agencies (like the US Helsinki Commission); and the NGOs (like Human Rights Watch). We will also look in some detail at human rights monitoring in the former Soviet Union.
GOVT4847;;;Realist Theories of International Relations;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;GOVT6847;;;"Realism" is often invoked in international relations to mean many different things. By policymakers, it has been cited as a source of support - and opposition - to America's recent wars.  By scholars, it is often used as a synonym for "structuralism", which it need not be.  In this course, we will look closely at the tradition of realism in IR theory, both to find out exactly what realism does stand for, and in order to better understand world politics more generally.
GOVT4949;;;Honors Seminar: Thesis Clarification and Research;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;Prerequisite: acceptance into honors program.;;;;;;Designed to support thesis writers in the honors program during the early stages of their research projects.
GOVT4959;;;Honors Thesis: Research and Writing;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;Prerequisite: GOVT 4949.;;;;;;
GOVT4999;;;Undergraduate Independent Study;;;1-4;;;Fall, spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;One-on-one tutorial arranged by the student with a faculty member of his or her choosing. Open to government majors doing superior work, and it is the responsibility of the student to establish the research proposal and to find a faculty sponsor. Applicants for independent study must present a well-defined program of study that cannot be satisfied by pursuing courses in the regularly scheduled curriculum. No more than 4 credits of independent study may count toward fulfillment of the major. Students who elect to continue taking this course for more than one semester must select a new theme or subject each semester. Credit can be given only for work that results in a satisfactory amount of writing. Emphasis is on the capacity to subject a body of related readings to analysis and criticism. Keep in mind that independent study cannot be used to fulfill the seminar requirement. The application form for independent study is available in 210 White Hall and must be completed at the beginning of the semester in which the course is being taken.
GOVT6019;;;Introduction to Probability and Applied Statistics;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;GOVT4019;;;The goal of this course is to introduce probability and statistics as fundamental building blocks for quantitative political analysis, with regression modeling as a focal application. We will begin with a brief survey of probability theory, types of measurements, and descriptive statistics. The bulk of the course then addresses inferential statistics, covering in detail sampling, methods for estimating unknown quantities, and methods for evaluating competing hypotheses. We will see how to formally assess estimators, and some basic principles that help to ensure optimality. Along the way, we will introduce the use of regression models to specify social scientific hypotheses, and employ our expanding repertoire of statistical concepts to understand and interpret estimates based on our data. Weekly lab exercises require students to deploy the methods both 'by hand' so they can grasp the basic mathematics, and by computer to meet the conceptual demands of non-trivial examples and prepare for independent research. Some time will be spent reviewing algebra, calculus, and elementary logic, as well as introducing computer statistical packages.
GOVT6021;;;Poverty & Social Policy;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;Poverty is an enduring phenomenon that baffles policymakers and confounds those who would offer simple solutions. This course explores the causes of poverty in the United States and analyzes the various policy strategies meant to address it. The first part of the course will assess the economic, social, and cultural theories that scholars have offered as explanations of persistent poverty while the second segment will examine specific policies related to welfare, labor markets, urban neighborhoods, family structure and the criminal justice system. Through all this, we will foreground the consequences of policy for the well-being of the poor and the role that the poor themselves play in shaping and responding to policy environments.
GOVT6029;;;Advanced Regression Analysis;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;Prerequisite: GOVT 6019 or permission of instructor.;;;;;;This course builds upon 6019, covering in detail the interpretation and estimation of multivariate linear regression models. We derive the Ordinary Least Squares estimator and its characteristics using matrix algebra and determine the conditions under which it achieves statistical optimality. We then consider the circumstances in social scientific contexts which commonly lead to assumption violations, and the detection and implications of these problems. This leads to modified regression estimators that can offer limited forms of robustness in some of these cases. Finally, we briefly introduce likelihood-based techniques that incorporate assumptions about the distribution of the response variable, focusing on logistic regression for binary dependent variables. Students are expected to produce a research paper built around a quantitative analysis that is suitable for presentation at a professional conference. Some time will be spent reviewing matrix algebra, and discussing ways to implement computations using statistical software.
GOVT6031;;;Field Seminar in American Politics;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;The major issues, approaches, and institutions of American government and the various subfields of American politics are introduced. The focus is on both substantive information and theoretical analysis, plus identification of big questions that have animated the field.
GOVT6039;;;Advanced Topics in Quantitative Empirical Methodology;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;We will gain experience with advanced statistical methods for social scientists--those incorporating complex statistical assumptions as well as those that relate to causality. Students will apply these methods in a series of labs with a heavy emphasis on computation, with the option wherever feasible to work with R, Stata, or (under self-direction) in some other preferred modeling environment. The first half of the course details maximum likelihood and Bayesian estimation frameworks as flexible strategies for tackling any data generating process. Two labs examine ordinal/multinomial, unrestricted count, and duration data, and working with a "custom" model. The third lab explores how to use a multi-level model to represent nonsphericity and heterogeneity. The second half of the course introduces a graphical grammar for representing causal dependence, with three additional labs oriented towards IV, matching/weighting, and multi-stage causal effects estimation.
GOVT6045;;;Law and Literature;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;ENGL3762;ENGL6710;LAW6710;;;What can lawyers and judges learn from the study of literature? This course explores the relevance of imaginative literature (novels, drama, poetry, and film) to questions of law and social justice from a range of perspectives. We will consider debates about how literature can help to humanize legal decision-making; how storytelling has helped to give voice to oppressed populations over history; how narratives of suffering cultivate popular support for human rights; the role played by storytelling in a trial; and how literature can shed light on the limits of law and public policy.
GOVT6053;;;Comparative Method in International and Comparative Politics;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;An in-depth, graduate-level introduction to qualitative and comparative methods of political analysis, with special emphasis on the application of these methods in comparative and international politics. Through readings, discussions, and written assignments, students will explore strategies for concept formation, theory construction, and theory testing, using the craft and tools of comparative political analysis.
GOVT6067;;;Field Seminar in International Relations;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;General survey of the literature and propositions of the international relations field. Criteria are developed for judging theoretical propositions and are applied to the major findings. Participants are expected to do extensive reading in the literature as well as research.
GOVT6075;;;Field Seminar in Political Thought: The Canon;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;The seminar will explore readings in the historical canon of political philosophy from Plato to the Twentieth century.
GOVT6122;;;Foundations of the Social Sciences;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;ECON6910;PHIL6422;;;Social science research almost always combines empirical observation (data), the construction of concepts (language), and the logical analysis of the relations between observations and concepts (statistics).  This course examines the relations between these three dimensions as the analyst moves from one to the other both as practice and in the crafting of a formal summary of findings and argument. We will be particularly interested in the foundational assumptions that underpin the connections between empirical reality, language, and statistical analysis. While these foundational assumptions are often taken for granted by social scientists, they vary dramatically between social science disciplines.  The implicit contradiction between that variance and their doxic acceptance within disciplines will be a primary focus of the course.
GOVT6182;;;Political Communication;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;This doctoral seminar examines scholarly research related to political communication, with particular attention to campaigns, elections, and policy debates. The focus is on questions related to elite strategy, the broader political context (such as economic conditions), and the conditions under which political campaigns affect political decision-making. Various forms of decision-making are considered, including decisions to turn out, choose a particular candidate, donate money, and volunteer time.
GOVT6201;;;The United States Congress;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;AMST6201;;;The United States Congress will be examined: first, as a "closed system" in which institutional arrangements decisively apportion political power; and, second, as the product of electoral and social forces outside the institution. Emphasis will be placed on the historical relationship between institutional growth and state formation, parliamentary rules as both arrangements within which the "rational choices" of legislators are played out and as deliberate, constructions and allocations of political influence, and the use of legislative behavior as evidence in the analysis of fundamental principles of politics. Because the literature on the lower chamber is generally more rich, the House of Representatives will receive greater attention than the Senate.
GOVT6203;;;The Idea of Africa Past and Present;;;4;;;;;;;;;;;;ASRC6209;;;This seminar grapples with the idea of Africa as symbol, metaphor, imaginary, and real; received, constructed, and self-enacting; a status, condition, and state of mind; performed, executed, or captured.
GOVT6263;;;Comparative Political Economy;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;This graduate seminar studies the intersection of markets and political institutions in both advanced industrial and developing regions of the world economy. Readings explore the ways in which political institutions and processes shape economic outcomes-such growth, development, inequality, etc.-as well as the ways in which economic crises and development patterns condition political outcomes (such as democracy, authoritarianism, party system development, and social protest). Students will conduct research and write a seminar paper on a political economy topic of their choice.
GOVT6303;;;Comparative Political Economy and Global Debates;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;ILRIC6330;;;From a perspective rooted in comparative political economy, this graduate seminar examines the politics of economic inequality in the United States and Europe.  The emphasis is contemporary: growing inequality, causes and consequences.  Active participation in discussion is expected, and each student will write a substantial term paper.
GOVT6324;;;Proseminar in Chinese Politics;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;This proseminar in Chinese politics has three goals. The first is to analyze Chinese politics from several dimensions (elite politics, Center-local relations, institutions, state and society, the military, etc.). The second is to situate China within the larger context of comparative politics more generally: what we can learn about China by leveraging insights from the subfield of comparative politics (the anthropology of the state, institutions, social movements, etc.) and vice versa? The third goal is to trace the evolution of the study of China from 1950s Kremlinology to the present day field-research continuously unfolding, and in real time, from all over China.
GOVT6353;;;Field Seminar in Comparative Politics;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;This course provides a graduate-level survey of the field of comparative politics, introducing students to classic works as well as recent contributions that build upon those works. Readings will draw from leading theoretical approaches-including structural, institutional, rational choice, and cultural perspectives-and cover a broad range of substantive topics, such as democratization, authoritarianism, states and civil society, political economy, and political participation and representation.
GOVT6406;;;Africa, Humanitarianism and Postcolonial Sensibilities;;;4;;;;;;;;;;;;ASRC6406;;;An examination of the 'African positions' on the ICC, humanitarianism, and the responsibility to protect, this course examines the questions of the human, ethics, law, and universality in global politics today. The course focuses particularly on the evolution of the idea of global moral trusteeship from the times of colonial mandates and interventions to postcolonial responses to the question of responsibilities to others.
GOVT6483;;;Authoritarianism and Democracy;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;The course will focus on the following issues. The first is defining democracy, dictatorship, and regimes that straddle the two (hybrids). The second is analyzing transitions to democracy, democratic breakdown and democratic consolidation. The third issue of interest is transitions to authoritarian politics and the resilience of, including challenges to, authoritarian regimes. Finally, we will also look at the relationship between regime type and other issues, such as economic performance, ethnic conflict and war. The geographical focus of the course will be broad, including the former communist world, East Asia, Southeast Asia, Latin America, the Middle East and Sub-Saharan Africa.
GOVT6554;;;Beyond Totalitarianism: Politics and Everyday Life in (Post) Socialism;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;ANTHR4055;ANTHR7055;GOVT4554;;;This seminar explores cultural, social and political transformations in the (post)socialist world through the methods and analytics of socio-cultural anthropology. Students will learn about the contradictions and paradoxes of socialist ideology and practice, and the enclosures and possibilities produced by socialism's fall. By combining theoretical readings, memoirs, ethnographic texts and films about the socialist period, "Beyond Totalitarianism" will foreground the domain of everyday life as the place where the nation-state, collective memory and political subjectivity become reconfigured in powerful and imaginative ways. While purposefully unraveling Cold War epistemologies, the seminar posits postsocialism as a framework and a critical standpoint from which to interrogate the problem of political will, which has been central to liberal conceptualizations of individual freedom and political agency.
GOVT6578;;;Critical Race Theory;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;AMST4587;AMST6587;ASRC4587;ASRC6587;GOVT4578;;;A political theory seminar that deals primarily with the conceptual and normative questions pertaining to racism and racial identity in the United States context.  Although the precise reading list will vary from year to year, the major figures and commentators may include W.E.B. Du Bois; Frederick Douglass; Booker T. Washington; Ida B. Wells; Charles Hamilton Houston; Thurgood Marshall; Hortense Spillers; Cornel West; Michael Dawson; Robin Kelley; Robert Gooding-Williams; Tommie Shelby; Cristina Beltran; Gary Okihiro; Gerald Torres; Rogers Smith; and Aziz Rana. The theme for 2015 will be African-American political thought and the "Long Civil Rights Movement." Ideally, students will have some background in African American studies and/or American political thought.
GOVT6606;;;The Politics of Pragmatism;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;AMST6606;;;This seminar will explore the intersection of political theory and American pragmatism. While questions of political theory have often been seen as external to the concerns of pragmatism as a philosophy, this course will consider what practical tools pragmatism makes available for the study of politics. Central to pragmatism's originality is its radical and social conception of experience, which will be our primary focus this semester. Beginning with a study of Emerson, we will explore classical and contemporary statements of pragmatism and their political consequences. Among other topics we will discuss action, inquiry, belief, faith, and power. We will also consider the attempts of other twentieth-century thinkers to rethink the nature of experience and its relationship to politics, including Bergson, Du Bois, and Whitehead.
GOVT6656;;;Topics in Social and Political Philosophy;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;AMST4655;AMST6656;GOVT4655;PHIL4470;PHIL6430;SOC4430;SOC6430;;;Topic: Equality Efforts to reduce inequality are central to the pursuit of justice. We will investigate leading philosophical controversies about the moral basis of these efforts. To what extent, in what ways and why should the economic inequalities that arise in modern market societies be reduced? At what point does the use of government to reduce economic inequality unjustly conflict with liberty? How should the ideal of political equality be understood? For example, is it fundamentally important that citizens' political influence be approximately equal? What do the values underlying demands for political equality imply about relationships in the workplace? Do duties to reduce economic and political inequality among fellow-citizens properly extend worldwide?
GOVT6696;;;Melancholy Left: Marx to Benjamin;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;COML4416;COML6416;FREN4435;FREN6435;GERST4431;GERST6431;GOVT4696;HIST4234;HIST6234;ROMS4430;ROMS6430;;;The fall of "real socialism" in 1990 put an end to the experience of twentieth century Marxism. Its ideas, debates and controversies could be viewed-historicized and revisited-in a different light. The defeated revolutions of the past century put into question a teleological vision of history, engendering the decline of Marxist historiography and the simultaneous appearance of memory, a previously ignored concept for interpreting the past. Outlining a symbolic shift from Marx to Benjamin, this change has a melancholic flavor that permeates many expressions of contemporary Left culture (from movies and autobiographies to historical and philosophical essays). On the other hand, the emergence of Postcolonialism reopened the debate on the Eurocentric roots of Marx's thought and stimulated a new approach to some classical Marxist thinkers and historians such as Gramsci and C.L.R. James. Taking into account both classical and contemporary texts, the seminar will analyze a reconfigured relationship between history and memory in the Left culture of our post-utopian age.
GOVT6706;;;Marx and Marxisms;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;COML6631;GERST6100;SPAN6100;;;The terms "Marx" and "Marxisms" have meant different things to different people, beginning with Marx himself and continuing in his legacy today.  As obviously, this legacy remains global (Europe, North and Latin America, India and Pakistan, Vietnam, Africa, Near East and Far East)--all still including imagined allies, neutrals, and foes.  This seminar is an approach to this otherwise bewildering complexity: we focus on two things: (1) a possible Marxist (or Communist or Anarchist) theory of all language and any semiotics; alongside (2) its equally possible inter-action with manuals of guerrilla warfare.
GOVT6736;;;Ancient Political Thought;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;CLASS7663;;;An in-depth study of a book, author, or debate in ancient political thought in its own right and also with a view to its bearing on contemporary democratic theory. In fall 2014, this course will focus on Plato's Republic, in conversation with a diverse set of modern and contemporary theorists from Carl Schmitt to Jacques Derrida.
GOVT6766;;;Pluralism;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;Pluralism is often invoked a basic 'fact' of modern politics. However, there is profound disagreement about exactly what political theorists mean by pluralism and whether this 'fact' should be thought of as a problem, a constraint, or a possibility. This seminar examines the concept of pluralism as it has been developed in liberal, conservative, democratic, and radical political thought. Topics to be discussed will include value pluralism, disagreement and dissensus, the politics of identity\difference, the role of religion in democratic politics, the relationship between affect and political conviction, and the turn to ethics in political theory. Authors studied may include Max Weber, Isaiah Berlin, Michael Oakeshott, Hannah Arendt, Carl Schmitt, John Rawls, William Connolly, James Tully, Ella Myers, George Shulman, and Nick Brommell.
GOVT6776;;;The Problem with Rights;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;AMST6472;COML6472;FGSS6472;HIST6472;LGBT6472;;;In June 2013, in the space of a week, the Supreme Court ruled on affirmative action, the legacy of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, and the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). While the first two decisions were perceived as a step back in the fight against racial discrimination, the repeal of DOMA was welcomed by mainstream LGBT-rights organizations as a decisive move towards equality. One of the goals of this seminar is to think these rulings together instead of treating them as separate entities. How did the struggle for sexual rights and the promotion of color blindness come to coexist so easily within the law? In order to understand how liberalism has operated historically and theoretically as a crucial site of regulation for sexuality and race, we will read texts from a wide range of contexts and disciplines including political theory, anthropology, literature, philosophy, history, and law. Readings will include "classic" critics of liberalism such as Marx, Nietzsche, Althusser, and Foucault, and contemporary authors such as Wendy Brown, Elizabeth Povinelli, Lisa Duggan, David Eng, Janet Halley, Katherine Franke, and Jasbir Puar, among others.
GOVT6779;;;Cosmopolitanism;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;COML6970;ENGL6970;;;This course will examine cosmopolitanism as a cultural, moral, and political concept both historically, with reference primarily to the eighteenth century, and theoretically, in contemporary debates. The aim will be to elaborate critically the universalist and egalitarian premises of the Enlightenment notion of cosmopolitical subjects and to evaluate what progressive or ideological functions this notion continues to play in discourses on sovereignty, human rights, religious tolerance, and cultural dissemination and aesthetic community. Works by Cicero, Hobbes, Adam Smith, Rousseau, Kant, and Marx will be read with those by Arendt, Balibar, Derrida, Habermas, Honig, and other contemporary theorists.
GOVT6786;;;The Holocaust in Postwar Culture (1945-1961);;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;COML4415;COML6415;FREN4415;FREN6415;GERST4411;GERST6411;GOVT4786;HIST4233;HIST6233;JWST4410;JWST6415;ROMS4410;ROMS6410;;;There is an astonishing discrepancy between our perception of the Holocaust as a central event of the twentieth century and its marginal place in postwar culture.  It is during those years, nevertheless, that the destruction of European Jews aroused an intellectual debate whose philosophical, political, and literary contributions constitute landmarks for contemporary culture and criticism.  The course will explore the reasons for such a discrepancy, reconstructing the steps of the integration of the Holocaust into our historical consciousness.  It will analyze some of the most significant attempts to think such a trauma made by German-Jewish exiles (Arendt, Adorno, Anders), the survivors of the Nazi camps (Amery, Levi, Celan, Antelme), as well as the public intellectuals on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean (Sartre, Bataille, MacDonald, etc).
GOVT6805;;;Race & Racism/Law & Society;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;AMST4800;AMST6800;ASRC4805;ASRC6805;GOVT4805;;;A seminar that examines contemporary dilemmas in the construction of race and ethnicity in law, and the racialized construction of social problems and governmentality. We will examine classics in the field and new works, including those by Gerald Torres and Lani Guinier, Dorothy Roberts, Michelle Alexander, Jack Balkin, Derrick Bell, Osagie Obasojie, and the famous legal studies anthologies on critical race theory and law and society edited by Richard Delgado and Jean Stenfancic; and Kimberle Crenshaw, Neil Gotanda, Gary Peller, and Kendall Thomas. The issues that we will explore include: mass incarceration; the history and meaning of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; the social construction of race and ethnicity; the intractable character and historicity of white domination; and the history of black "cause lawyering."  Strong preference will be given to graduate students, law students, and undergraduates with previous coursework in the field.
GOVT6847;;;Realist Theories of International Relations;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;GOVT4847;;;"Realism" is often invoked in international relations to mean many different things. By policymakers, it has been cited as a source of support-and opposition-to America's recent wars. By scholars, it is often used as a synonym for "structuralism," which it need not be. In this course, we will look closely at the tradition of realism in IR theory, both to find out exactly what realism does stand for, and in order to better understand world politics more generally.
GOVT6857;;;International Political Economy;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;Exploration into a range of contemporary theories and research topics in the field of international political economy. The seminar covers different theoretical perspectives and a number of substantive problems.
GOVT6897;;;International Security;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;This course will examine a variety of international relations theories in studying a broad range of security issues, including the causes of war, alliance formation, balance-of-power politics, security regimes, nuclear and conventional deterrence, the democratic peace, military strategy, international terrorism, and domestic constraints on the use of force. We will use a variety of theoretical perspectives to investigate these and other issues, paying particular attention to evaluating the theoretical arguments with both historical and systematic evidence. 
GOVT6927;;;Planning and Management of Agriculture and Rural Development;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;IARD6030;;;An intercollege course designed to provide graduate students with a multidisciplinary perspective on the administration of agricultural and rural development activites in developing countries.  The course is oriented to students in agricultural or social sciences who may have administrative responsiblities during their professional careers.  Reviews experience and approaches in agricultural and rural development in a range of developing countries, with particular attention to contemporary issues of participation, decentralization, local institutions, capacity-building, civil society, social capital, and empowerment. Case studies from Asia, Africa, and Latin America.
GOVT6999;;;CPAS Weekly Colloquium;;;1;;;Fall, spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;Colloquium is the weekly seminar series hosted by the Cornell Institute for Public Affairs (CIPA). It is also a required, 1-credit course for all CIPA Fellows and is graded S-U based on attendance. The colloquium series is a collaborative effort between the CIPA Colloquium Committee and the faculty and staff of CIPA.
GOVT7073;;;Game Theory 1;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;This is the first in a two course sequence that introduces graduate students in political science to game theory, a tool for studying strategic interaction that is now used throughout the discipline. In the first course, students will learn the basics concepts of game theory and how to solve most of types of games used in applied political science work. The course requires only high-school level mathematics, and no prior training in game theory or formal methods.
GOVT7074;;;Game Theory 2;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;Prerequisite: GOVT 7073.;;;;;;This is the second of two graduate courses on game theory in the government department. In this course, we will study in a more detailed and advanced fashion types of games that have received heavy use in political science, such as repeated games, games of imperfect information (e.g., signaling games), and bargaining. There will be a strong focus on contemporary applications of these games and preparing students to develop their own models. Prerequisites: Game Theory I or permission of instructor. 
GOVT7999;;;Independent Study;;;1-4;;;Fall, spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;Individualized readings and research for graduate students. Topics, readings, and writing requirements are designed through consultation between the student and the instructor. Graduate students in government who are looking to use this as an option to fulfill their course requirements should check with their chairs to be certain that the program of study is acceptable for this purpose. Applications must be completed and signed by the instructor and by the chairs of their special committees. They are available from, and must be returned to, the graduate assistant in 212 White Hall.

The course first explores brain pathways for processing visual, auditory, body and face movements, and tactile stimuli that comprise the raw material used to judge the emotional significance of external events. Next, brain regions involved in the (1) emotional evaluation of that sensory input, and (2) emotional expression once a significant event is identified are described. Then, brain processes underlying the special nature of human emotional experience (subjective feelings) are explored. All of these basic emotional processes are extended by placing them within widespread brain networks that modulate emotional behavior. There is an emphasis on social contexts and the development of social emotions, including social bonding and social rejection. The manner in which emotional stress influences learning and memory, with implications for PTSD, concludes the course.

The course mirrors HD 2580 "Six Pretty Good Books," an introductory lecture course for entering students and students whose majors are outside the social and behavioral sciences. Both classes (2580 and 4580) will use the same set of readings, but the seminar format is a weekly 90-minute in-depth discussion rather than lecture. Most importantly, unlike 2580, 4580 is not about the books; rather, it is about how to teach the books.  Much of our in-class analysis of the books centers on identifying what are the key contributions to knowledge, as well as important limitations, and how best to communicate these ideas to students with little background in the social sciences. All students are provided the opportunity to lead one or more discussion groups in 2580.  In addition to facilitating metacognitive understanding of the books, the seminar has two additional goals: 1) to provide advanced undergraduates with an opportunity to summon, integrate, and apply insights that they have acquired over the course of their undergraduate education as they analyze arguments from the standpoint of multiple social sciences, and 2) to integrate scholarship across disciplinary lines, a major goal of University Courses.

Because of the multidisciplinary nature of the course, students from a variety of backgrounds in academic disciplines, gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, race, class, and religious affiliation attend.
HD4660;;;Psychobiology of Temperament and Personality;;;3;;;Fall.;;;;;;Prerequisite: HD 3660.;;;HD6660;;;Seminar oriented to students planning to enter either a Ph.D. program in biological aspects of psychology or an M.D. program. It relies on basic research literature that requires detailed studying. The development of neurobehavioral systems as a means of adapting to critical stimuli has formed the basis of emotional systems in humans, and individual differences in these systems form the basis of temperament and personality. The nature of temperament and personality is explored from psychometric, experiential, genetic, and neurobiological points of view. There is a focus on the general role played by the biogenic amines (dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin), neuropeptides (corticotrophin releasing hormone, opiates, oxytocin), genetic polymorphisms in these neuromodulators, and early experience in determining individual differences in temperament and personality.

HINDI3302;;;Advanced Hindi II;;;3;;;Spring.;;;;;;Prerequisite: HINDI 3301 or permission of instructor.;;;;;;This is a continuation of HINDI 3301. Selected readings in modern Hindi literature. Continued work on fluency in speaking Hindi on an advanced level. There will be a combination of different reading materials from literature, journals, newspapers, and many social, entertainment, and political magazines in Hindi. Discussions will be based on those readings and articles, hence giving opportunities to express views and opinions in a fluent and effective manner.
HIST1102;;;FWS: All Over the Map: Cartography in the Making of Boundaries, Places, and Histories;;;3;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;What's in a map? Can they obscure as much as they reveal? This course focuses on the way maps, and their boundaries, intrude on the stories we tell. Histories, in particular, typically concern places that fit neatly within boundaries-be they city limits, international borders, or shorelines. Rather than treating these features as naturally occurring, we will ask questions, such as: Can a place be said to have existed before its so-called discovery? Do the names of nations, continents, cities, or even harbors simply refer to places, or can they somehow help bring those very places into being? Seminar discussions and assignments will largely revolve around assigned readings, assigned maps (which we will often consult in conjunction with the readings), and writing exercises.
HIST1104;;;FWS: Empire and Democracy: Ancient to Modern;;;3;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;Classical Athens and the Roman Republic were governed by democratic institutions which were unprecedented in scale and exceptional in the demands placed on their citizens. Democracy also went hand in hand with war: under forms of democratic governance, both Athens and Rome formed empires and pursued policies that brought their citizens into a war of some kind almost every year. This course will focus on the connections between democracy and imperialism based on primary sources, including Herodotus, Thucydides, Aristotle, Polybius, Cicero, and Livy. By engaging directly with the ancient sources, writing assignments will explore theories of imperialism, the nature of Athenian and Roman political institutions, interactions with subject peoples, and the strains of war on society. We will conclude the course with comparisons to American democracy.
HIST1105;;;FWS: Centuries of Bloodshed? Violence in the Middle Ages;;;3;;;Fall, spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;The supposedly widespread violence of the Middle Ages frequently captures modern attention. Graphic violence is often a selling point for medieval-themed media, such as HBO's Game of Thrones series.  Often, medieval violence seems to be pointless and cruel; a barbaric aspect of a less civilized time. Was violence in the Middle Ages as senseless as it seems to us? How did the denizens of the Middle Ages experience this violence? Were they as appalled or intrigued by it as we seem to be? This course will consider the way medieval authors interpreted and represented violence in a variety of genres including history, law, and literature.
HIST1106;;;FWS: The Prize and the Peril: African Nations at Fifty;;;3;;;Fall, spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;The recent Jubilee celebrations of fifty years of African independence offer an apt moment to assess the legacy of the nationalist movements that brought about independence and the nations they spawned. One observer has argued that even in countries with "nothing to celebrate," all jubilee nations eventually featured "some form of official commemoration." Why were these commemorations so important to Africans? Why does nationalism continue to catalyze such heated debate, in Africa as around the world?  What does "independence" mean anyway? This course examines the tension over who gets to define "the nation" in Africa and why. The goal will be to analyze historical debates on "the nation" in Africa and to write persuasive arguments assessing them.
HIST1107;;;FWS: Revolution & Renewal: China's Modern Transformation;;;3;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;What does the future hold for China? This question increasingly occupies the minds of policy makers, businesspeople, and intellectuals the world over. In this course, students will explore China's past for insights that will prepare them to think critically about China's position in the world today and tomorrow. We will examine multiple facets of China's changing sense of itself and its destiny during the twentieth century, from Chinese conceptions of revolution and political order to the impact of economic development on China's identity. Readings will include works by Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping, and other historical figures, as well as writings by influential scholars such as Henry Kissinger and Jonathan Spence. Writing assignments will allow students to consider what China's past may mean for its future.
HIST1110;;;FWS: Paper Politics: Writing in India, 1700-Present;;;3;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;The Indian subcontinent poses a paradox in histories of the written word. Despite high rates of illiteracy, it has produced vibrant textual traditions in over a dozen vernacular and a few "global" languages. Yet what institutional and social contexts have informed the cultures of writing in South Asia? We address this question through historical and anthropological perspectives. Readings and discussions will focus on the worlds of the Mughal scribe, the colonial book printer, and the bazaar public sphere. We shall learn of the written labor of subordinate clerks and peons, and follow the paper trail to the halls of postcolonial bureaucratic offices. Our aim will thus be to understand the dynamics of writing and power that have historically constituted state and popular politics in South Asia.
HIST1190;;;FWS: Gandhi and the Politics of Non-Violence;;;3;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;This course will examine the writings of Mohandas K. Gandhi, a leader of the nonviolent movement against British colonialism in India.  In particular, students will consider whether Gandhi's philosophies of self-reliance, moral discipline, civil disobedience, nonviolent protest, and vegetarianism are applicable to living in the modern world.  We will read some of Gandhi's well-known criticisms of modernity, including Hind Swaraj and My Experiments with Truth, and address the sources, impact and legacy of Gandhi's ideas, including the relationship between Gandhian non-violence and the American civil rights movement. Written assignments will involve close readings of Gandhi's work with an eye toward engaging whether his ideas translate to being a modern and morally responsible individual in the early twenty-first century.
HIST1213;;;FWS: State Surveillance in History;;;3;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;How and why do states watch their citizens? This course explores historical practices of state surveillance from the perspective of both the "watchers" and the "watched." Special emphasis will be given to twentieth-century Europe, but examples from other parts of the world and the US will also be featured in the readings. Some of the readings will be primary sources: memoirs, diaries, surveillance files. Other sources will include films and short fiction and some scholarly pieces on the workings of state security and secret police organizations.
HIST1250;;;FWS: Conceived in Liberty: The Coming of Civil War and Black Emancipation;;;3;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;This course examines the American Civil War through the lens of African-Americans in the north and south and through the vision of white radicals who had challenged slavery for a generation. Together, they became the movement that fomented a revolution and changed America forever. We will read the speeches and other writings of black and white radicals; we will examine the slaves response to the Civil War; we will examine the changing goals of the war, and we will analyze Abraham Lincoln's leadership.
HIST1321;;;FWS: Post-World War II America: Crisis and Continuity;;;3;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;Why are the years following World War II considered so remarkable in the landscape of American history? Several critical events and debates that rocked the nation from the 1940s onward reverberate today, such as involvement in wars, civil rights, women's rights, concerns about teenagers, and crises in American cities. Enriched by a variety of primary sources, including films and TV shows, this course analyzes the central events, people, and forces that transformed American society and culture from the years after World War II to the present. The course aims to help students learn how to write persuasively about scholarship and primary sources, while gaining a deeper appreciation for the lasting influence of the major events, crises, and interpretations of post-World War II American history.
HIST1451;;;FWS: Rewriting Africa and World War II;;;3;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;What was going on in Africa during World War II?  Most of us know that World War II was one of the most transformative periods in the history of the 20th century.  Similarly, most people know that it was fought in multiple regions simultaneously and utilized human and natural resources from across the globe.  Yet though numerous histories have been written about the war, and memorials to soldiers and civilians dot the landscape, most accounts of the war marginalize Africa's role and the consequences of the war for African communities.   This course reconsiders Africa's social, economic and political engagement in the war and introduces students to emerging debates in African historiography and the historiography of World War II.
HIST1503;;;Radicals and Reformers in Lincoln's America;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;;;;In 1857, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that African Americans, even if born free, could not be citizens of the land of their birth.  By 1867, black southerners were crafting new state constitutions and standing for state and local office; in the fall of 1870, the first African American congressman and senator arrived in Washington. This course examines the long and often brutal struggle to fulfill the promise of President Lincoln made at Gettysburg, that eighty-seven years after the founding of the republic, the nation would at long last actually practice its self-evident truth of liberty and freedom for all. Covering a half century, the course discusses the shifting alliances and complicated personalities - black and white, local and national, male and female - who sought to advance and maintain political and social quality during the Civil War and in the three decades after the bloody conflict.
HIST1510;;;Introduction to Western Civilization I;;;4;;;Fall, summer.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;;;;The West and its relations with the rest of the world are central topics today, but just what is the West and what is its history? This course surveys the history of the West from remote antiquity to the 16th century. We will consider developments in technology, economy, politics, religious institutions and faiths, cultural media and social ideals. Together, these themes add up to civilization in the west. We will acquaint ourselves with these dimensions of the past while seeking to acquire the basic skills professional historians use to learn about this past.
HIST1511;;;The Making of Modern Europe, from 1500 to the Present;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;;;;How do we make sense of the recent controversies around Islam and the "veil" in France, the reform of the Welfare State in Great-Britain, the anti-globalization protests in Davos, the rise of demagogic anti-immigrant parties from the Netherlands to Italy, or the fact that Swedes get more than thirty paid days off per year? This course seeks to answer these questions by exploring the history of modern Europe. Among other themes, we will discuss the Protestant Reformation, the rise of absolutism, the Enlightenment, the French Revolution, industrialism, colonialism, the Russian Revolution, the two world wars, decolonization and immigration, May '68, and the construction of the European Union. In conjunction, we will examine how modern ideologies (liberalism, Marxism, imperialism, conservatism, fascism, totalitarianism) were developed and challenged. Through a wide array of historical documents (fiction, letters, philosophy, treatises, manifestos, films, and art), we will consider why "old Europe" is still relevant for us today.
HIST1561;;;Introduction to the Ottoman Empire;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;JWST1561;NES1561;;;This course will introduce students to the study of the Ottoman Empire from its inception in the 12th century until the modernization reforms of the 19th century. Topics will include an introduction to the main timeline of the geographical expansion of the Empire, the consolidation of the imperial power during the "Golden Age" of Suleyman the Magnificent and finally the transformation in the imperial system of rule from the 17th to the 19th century. Special emphasis will be placed on the Ottoman diverse social make up and the evolution of the imperial and provincial governments' relationships with the various socio-cultural groups, economic systems, legal practices, and inter-communal relations within the empire's urban centers.  This demanding course should provide the student with the necessary background knowledge to pursuing further studies in the history of the Modern Middle East and the Eastern Mediterranean.
HIST1581;;;America at War to 1898;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;AMST1581;;;This course propels students into the chaos, destruction, and often brutal violence experienced by inhabitants of North America prior to the 20th century. Students will analyze armed conflict and its relationship to the history of human societies in North America from 10,000 B.C.E. (the beginnings of recorded human warfare) to 1898 (the commencement of American efforts to project its military strength into the wider world). Key themes of the course include: pre-contact indigenous warfare and its legacies in conflicts between indigenous nations and intruding settler societies; imperial contests for control over North American territory and resources; the creation of the United States' military institutions and the role of warfare in shaping the American nation-state; the relationship between the "winning of the west" during the late nineteenth century and the origins of American military interventions abroad; and the contrast between an understanding of warfare as a lived human experience and its memorialization through writing, reporting, commemoration, debating, and myth-making.
HIST1590;;;History and Popular Culture;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;ASRC1590;;;This course uses a multidisciplinary approach to explore the complex relationship between history and popular culture in Africa. The course considers two main questions - How can you write history using popular culture? And how do artists use history to create popular culture? It uses examples from around the continent to explore old and new forms of popular culture; forms of cultural expression used by historians; as well as the ways in which artists use moments of great historical significance or key historical actors in their works. We consider, for example, the work of Leroy Vail who used songs by Mozambican peasants to write a social history of colonialism as well as films about colonialism by African film-makers such as the late Ousman Sembene.
HIST1600;;;History of Law: Great Trials;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;;;;Through discussion of a variety of high-profile and lesser-known trials throughout history, this course will examine a range of issues in the history of law and criminality. We will study the changing conceptions of justice and punishment, trials as a form of social marginalization, and the relationship between ideology--imperialism, liberalism, communism, fascism--and law. Cases to be covered include: Socrates, Jesus Christ, Joan of Arc, animal trials, Galileo, witch trials, Marie-Antoinette, the Dreyfus Affair, the Stalinist show trials, the war crimes trials at Nuremberg, Adolf Eichmann, and O.J. Simpson.
HIST1620;;;Histories of the Future;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;STS1102;;;From Frankenstein to The Matrix, science fiction and film have depicted contemporary science, technology, and medicine for almost two centuries. This course introduces students to historical and social studies of science and technology using science-fiction films and novels, as well as key readings in science and technology studies. What social questions can fictional accounts raise that factual ones can only anticipate? How have "intelligent machines" from Babbage's Analytical Engine to Hal raised questions about what it means to be human? What can Marvel Comics teach us about changes in science and technology? When can robots be women and, in general, what roles did gender play in scientific, technological, and medical stories? How was the discovery that one could look inside the human body received? How do dreams and nightmares of the future emerge from the everyday work of scientific and technological research?
HIST1630;;;The International Laws of War;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;;;;Is the use of drones legal? Are terrorist covered by the Geneva Convention? In this course students will learn the history and core concepts of the laws of armed conflict and will apply them to difficult contemporary questions such as these. The course covers the major controversies surrounding international law in order to enable students to recognize the spectrum of genuine legal debate and distinguish it from spurious arguments. The goal is to prepare students to make reasoned judgments about the application of law to war.
HIST1670;;;Understanding Modern China;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;ASIAN1167;;;As China moves forward, it often looks back to its past.  History has shaped both China's current developments and the way that many make sense of these transformations.  In surveying this history from the seventeenth century to the present, this course aims to provide an understanding of the changes, continuities, and contingencies in the making of modern China.  Topics will include the formation and fall of imperial power under the Qing Dynasty, the challenges of building a nation under the Republic, and the patterns and contradictions of social revolution under state socialism.  Attention will also be given to issues of economy, environment, ethnicity, gender, and the politics of history.  This course is open to all students and assumes no prior knowledge of Chinese culture, history, or language.
HIST1700;;;History of Exploration: Land, Sea, and Space;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;ASTRO1700;;;From ancient Mediterranean seafarers to the Mars rovers, from Christopher Columbus to the Apollo astronauts, humans have for centuries explored the far reaches of our planet. Now we are venturing into the solar system and beyond. This course will examine the history of such human activity. Among the topics covered are motives for exploration, technological advances that assist exploration, obstacles that must be overcome, and positive and negative consequences of exploration. It is led by Steven Squyres of Astronomy and Mary Beth Norton of History; lecturers include a number of historians and a former director of the Shoals Marine Laboratory.
HIST1800;;;Immigration in U.S. History;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;AMST1800;LSP1800;;;This course examines immigration as a major theme in U.S. history and culture. We will discuss immigration in different periods of our national history, and in different locations, from Boston and New York to San Diego, San Francisco, and Honolulu. We will also examine these migrations in a global context since they were part of a worldwide migration that affected millions of people. Lectures, readings, and discussions will examine popular, legal, and political responses to immigration, as reflected in legislation and policy, as well as film, art, literature, and the print media.
HIST1910;;;Introduction to Modern Asian History;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;ASIAN1191;CAPS1910;;;This introductory course follows the history of Asia-Pacific from the nineteenth century to the present, focusing on relations of China, India, Japan, South, and Southeast Asia. This course is intended for students wanting a broad historical overview of what makes Asia distinctive and important in a global economy and in world politics.
HIST1941;;;The History of Science in Europe: From the Ancient Legacy to Isaac Newton;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;BSOC1941;STS1941;;;How did the approaches to knowledge of nature that developed in medieval and early-modern Europe create an enterprise that associated the practical manipulation of nature with scientific truth? This course surveys intellectual approaches to the natural world from the theologically-shaped institutions of the Middle Ages to the Scientific Revolution of the 16th and 17th centuries. Ancient Greek authors such as Aristotle and Archimedes were used in diverse ways that came to usher in an era of European global expansion. By the late 17th century, a new kind of practically applicable science attempted to demonstrate Francis Bacon's famous claim that "knowledge is power."
HIST1950;;;The Invention of the Americas;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;LATA1950;;;When did the 'Americas' come in to being?  Who created 'them' and how? What other geographic units of analysis might we consider in thinking about what Iberian explorers and intellectuals initially called the 'fourth part' of the world?  Given the scope and extent of the Spanish and Portuguese empires, could 'the Americas' extend from the Caribbean to the Philippines?  This course takes up such questions as a means to explore the history of what would become-only in the nineteenth century-'Latin America.' We move from the initial "encounters" of peoples from Africa and Iberia with the "New World," the creation of long-distance trade with, and settlement in, Asia, and the establishment of colonial societies, through to the movements for independence in most of mainland Spanish America in the early 19th century and to the collapse of Spanish rule in the Pacific and Caribbean later that century. Through lectures, discussions and the reading of primary sources and secondary texts, the course examines the economic and social organization of the colonies, intellectual currents and colonial science, native accommodation and resistance to colonial rule, trade networks and imperial expansion, labor regimes and forms of economic production, and migration and movement.
HIST1970;;;History of the Caribbean: From Conquest to Revolution;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;ASRC1790;;;What is the Caribbean? How did its native inhabitants fared in the aftermath of the arrival of Europeans? How did the region shift from a Spanish Lake to a heavily contested geopolitical site where all European powers vied for political and commercial superiority? What were the main production systems of the region and how did they result in dramatic environmental change? How did the eighteenth-century revolutions transform the Caribbean? In this introductory survey to Caribbean history we will answer these and many other questions through the study of the political, economic, social, cultural, and environmental transformations of the Caribbean from the arrival of Columbus to the era of the Haitian Revolution. We will follow indigenous people, Spanish conquistadors, English, Dutch, and French pirates and privateers, planters, and merchants, imperial officers, slaves, sailors, and revolutionaries as they adapted to the multiple transformations that shaped this region. Through lectures, discussions, and readings of primary and secondary sources we will navigate the Caribbean in a quest to understand the historical processes that gave shape to this tropical paradise.

HIST2005;;;The First American University;;;1;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;AMST2001;ENGL2999;;;Educational historian Frederick Rudolph called Cornell University "the first American university," referring to its unique role as a coeducational, nonsectarian, land-grant institution with a broad curriculum and diverse student body. In this course, we will explore the history of Cornell, taking as our focus the pledge of Ezra Cornell and Andrew Dickson White to found a university where "any person can find instruction in any study." The course will cover a wide range of topics and perspectives relating to the faculty, student body, evolution of campus, and important events and eras in Cornell history. Stories and vignettes will provide background on the current university and its administrative structure, campus traditions, and the names that adorn buildings and memorials throughout campus. Finally, the course will offer a forum for students to address questions on present-day aspects of the university.
HIST2022;;;The Global 1960's;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;;;;This course examines the creation of the anticolonial Third World and its influence on the student and revolutionary movements of the 1960s. Through a series of case studies including Algeria, Bolivia, the United States, India, Mexico, and Brazil, we will consider how the theory and strategies of decolonization shaped the revolutionary consciousness of individuals and movements around the world in the early sixties, and how the dominant ideologies and practices of development, detente, imperialism, and state repression spurred the global uprisings of 1968. Finally, we will examine the popular memory of the global 1960s in the United States, attempting to account for subsequent revisions and elisions.
HIST2085;;;The Enlightenment: The Birth of Modern Thought;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;;;;Until the 18th century, criminals and heretics were tortured and killed before large crowds of spectators, Jews and other outcasts were required to wear special badges and segregated from the rest of society, and Kings were thought to be the representatives of God's majesty on earth. In the middle of the 18th century, these and other long-standing traditions came under attack by a cultural and intellectual revolution known as "The Enlightenment." In reading circles, coffee houses, and salons from Paris and London to Philadelphia, a new system of thought developed and spread throughout Europe and the colonies. Through the writings of Voltaire, Rousseau, Montesquieu, and others, we will explore the radical ideas about politics, religion, law, race, and gender by which intellectuals claimed to be sweeping away the "barbarism" of the old world and ushering in the modern "Age of Reason."
HIST2122;;;Darwin and the Making of Histories;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;BSOC2122;STS2122;;;The power of a name is sometimes as great as that of an idea. This course will study who Darwin was in his own time, and how he became, then and now, an icon rather than just a Victorian naturalist. We will look at writings of Darwin himself, and attempt to understand what they meant in their own time, how Darwin came to write them, and how his contemporaries helped to shape their future.  How did Victorian ideologies of gender, race, and class shape the production and reception of Darwin's work? We will also examine the growth of "Darwinism" as a set of broader social and cultural movements, particularly in Britain and the United States. Were eugenics movements examples or perversions of Darwinism?  Finally, we will consider how Darwin's name has been used by more recent evolutionary biologists such as Steven Jay Gould, and by American anti-evolutionists.
HIST2131;;;Energy in History;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;STS2231;;;In this seminar, we will explore the role of energy as a force in the driving of history.  With the widespread harnessing of fossil fuels in the nineteenth century as our pivot point, we will consider both the prior energy regimes of wood, wind, water, and human and animal muscle, as well as the politics of energy production and consumption from the industrial age to the present.  While attentive to issues of environmental impact, we will also examine the broader implications of energy use for social, economic, and political structures across time.  Readings will consist of both classic works and recent scholarship, with cases drawn from all around the globe.
HIST2163;;;History of the United Nations;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;;;;A general history of the United Nations from its origins to the present. The course will deal with changes  in the missions and operations of all the major departments of the UN and its associated organizations such as the World Health Organization and the Food and Agriculture Organization, but the emphasis will be on the crisis activities of the Security Council and peacekeeping activities in the field.
HIST2220;;;From the New Deal to the Age of Reagan;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;AMST2220;;;This seminar will explore some of the major political and cultural trends in the United States,  from the era of the Democratic New Dealer, Franklin D. Roosevelt, through the era of the conservative Republican, Ronald Reagan? This seminar will explore through primary source research and secondary readings  the key economic, political, and cultural characteristics and transformations of the period from 1930 though the turn of the century.  The course will examine the rise, persistence, and breakdown of the so-called "New Deal Order" and the crucial political shifts that we call the "Reagan Revolution." A key theme in this course will be the transformations and critiques of American liberalism and conservatism.
HIST2251;;;U.S. Immigration Narratives;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;AMST2251;LSP2251;;;Americans are conflicted about immigration.  We honor and celebrate (and commercialize) our immigrant heritage in museums, folklife festivals, parades, pageants, and historical monuments. We also build fences and detention centers, and pass more and more laws to bar access to the United States. Polls tell us that Americans are concerned about the capacity of the United States to absorb so many immigrants from around the world. How often have we heard the laments "Today's immigrants are too different. They don't want to assimilate" or "My grandparents learned English quickly, why can't they?" The assumption is that older generations 'Americanized' quickly but that today's immigrants do not want to assimilate. Did 19th century immigrants really migrate to the United States to "become Americans"? Did they really assimilate quickly? Are today's immigrants really all that different from the immigrants who arrived earlier? Why do these particular narratives have such power and currency? This seminar will explore these issues and help students discern fact from fiction.
HIST2262;;;Medicine and Healing in China;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;ASIAN2262;BSOC2261;CAPS2262;STS2261;;;An exploration of processes of change in medicine in China.  Focuses on key transitions, such as the emergence of canonical medicine, of Daoist approaches to healing and longevity, of Buddhist medicine and medical relief, of "Scholar Physicians," and of "traditional Chinese medicine" in modern China.  Examines the development of new healing practices in relation to both popular and specialist views of the body and disease, "cultivating vitality" practices, modes of transmission of medical knowledge, and healer-patient relations.
HIST2295;;;Race, Class and Gender at Cornell University;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HIST2352;;;Paul Robeson and the Revolutionary Imagination;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;AMST2352;ASRC2352;;;Radical activist and artist Paul Robeson was one of the most beloved and persecuted black men in American history. His life, writing, artistic production, and iconic image helped shape political and artistic movements in the U.S. and beyond from the 1930s to the 1950s. Robeson was not only the first black man to play Othello on Broadway, he was also a key figure in black freedom movements, anticolonial movements, and labor movements in the first half of the twentieth century. From the Popular Front era of the 1930s through the arid political climate of the 1950s, Robeson's activism inspired, propelled, and expanded freedom movements in the U.S. and abroad. This course will examine Robeson's life as a way of understanding those movements.
HIST2500;;;Technology in Society;;;3;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;ECE2500;ENGRG2500;STS2501;;;Investigates the social, technical, political, and economic history of technology in Europe and the United States from the Industrial Revolution in the late 18th century to the present. Topics include industrialization, modernization, and globalization. We study such themes as the government's promotion and regulation of technology; gender, race, and labor issues; and the relationship between technological and social change.
HIST2501;;;Creating Contemporary Cornell;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;AMST2003;GOVT2002;;;Creating Contemporary Cornell will examine the history of Cornell from 1945-Present. Using a multi-disciplinary approach, the course will address the bureaucratization, politicization, and globalization of Cornell and the end of in loco parentis in the context of World War II, the Cold War, the civil rights movement, Vietnam, and the emergence of China.
HIST2542;;;The Making of Contemporary Africa;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;ASRC2542;;;Most people learn about Africa through the media.  However, media critics note that coverage is disproportionately skewed toward negative stories - poverty, war and corruption. While these factors are a reality for too many people on the continent, media observers note that too often the coverage lacks context and breadth.  Furthermore, media outlets do not report positive developments even where they exist.  This course will provide some of the depth and context necessary to understand events in contemporary Africa.  The first two-thirds of the course will examine African social and economic history since the nineteenth century - Africa's integration in the international economy, the rise of new social classes, the creation of the colonial state and the post-colonial state.  Our primary examples will be drawn from  East, West and Southern Africa to highlight both the similarities and differences of their historical development.  The final third of the course will examine several contemporary issues in which scholars and journalists have attempted to address the weaknesses in general press coverage.
HIST2581;;;Environmental History;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;AMST2581;BSOC2581;;;This lecture course serves as an introduction to the historical study of humanity's interrelationship with the natural world. Environmental history is a quickly evolving field, taking on increasing importance as the environment itself becomes increasingly important in world affairs. During this semester, we'll examine the sometimes unexpected ways in which "natural" forces have shaped human history (the role of germs, for instance, in the colonization of North America); the ways in which human beings have shaped the natural world (through agriculture, urbanization, and industrialization, as well as the formation of things like wildlife preserves); and the ways in which cultural, scientific, political, and philosophical attitudes toward the environment have changed over time. This is designed as an intensely interdisciplinary course: we'll view history through the lenses of ecology, literature, art, film, law, anthropology, and geography. Our focus will be on the United States, but, just as environmental pollutants cross borders, so too will this class, especially toward the end, when we attempt to put U.S. environmental history into a geopolitical context. This course is meant to be open to all, including non-majors and first-year students.
HIST2640;;;Introduction to Asian American History;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;AAS2130;AMST2640;;;An introductory history of Chinese, Japanese, Asian Indians, Filipinos, and Koreans in the United States from the mid-nineteenth century to the 1990s. Major themes include racism and resistance, labor migration, community formation, imperialism, and struggles for equality.
HIST2650;;;Ancient Greece from Homer to Alexander the Great;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;CLASS2675;;;A survey of Greece from the earliest times to the end of the Classical period in the late fourth century B.C. The course focuses on the Greek genius: its causes, its greatness, its defects, and its legacy. The Heroic Age, the city-state, ancient democracy, and the intellectual ferment of the Greek Enlightenment are the main topics of study. Readings in translation from Homer, Aristophanes, Sophocles, Herodotus, Thucydides, Plato, Aristotle, and from the evidence of ancient inscriptions, coins, art, and architecture.
HIST2660;;;Everything You Know About Indians is Wrong: Unlearning Native American History;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;AIS2660;AMST2660;;;One thing many Americans think they know is their Indians: Pocahontas, the First Thanksgiving, fighting cowboys, reservation poverty, and casino riches. Under our very noses, however, Native American history has evolved into one of the most exciting, dynamic, and contentious fields of inquiry into America's past. It is now safer to assume, as Comanche historian Paul Chaat Smith has pointed out, that everything you know about Indians is in fact wrong. Most people have much to "unlearn" about Native American history before true learning can take place. This course aims to achieve that end by (re)introducing students to key themes and trends in the history of North America's indigenous nations. Employing an issues-oriented approach, the course stresses the ongoing complexity of Native American societies' engagements with varieties of settler colonialism since 1492 and dedicates itself to a concerted program of myth-busting. As such, the course will provide numerous opportunities for students to develop their critical thinking and reading skills.
HIST2671;;;History of Rome II;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;CLASS2682;;;This course is the second part of a two-term survey of Roman history and will examine the history of the Roman Empire from the beginnings of the Augustan Principate (31 BC) to the fall of the Western Empire in the fifth century (476 AD). We will consider the creation and development of the imperial regime, explore the various types of challenges (military, cultural, and religious) to the hegemony of the Roman state, and try to understand the transformations of Roman society and culture down to the middle of the fifth century AD.
HIST2672;;;History of Modern Egypt;;;3;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;ASRC2670;NES2670;;;This lecture class will explore the socio-cultural history of modern Egypt from the late 18th century to the 21st century "Arab Spring." We will explore Egyptian history under the Ottomans and the Mamluks, the unsuccessful French attempts to colonize Egypt, and the successful British occupation of the country. We will then examine the development of Egyptian nationalism from the end of the 19th century through Nasser's pan-Arabism to the 2011 Egyptian Revolution. We will accomplish this with the aid of a variety of texts and media, including novels and films.
HIST2674;;;History of the Modern Middle East: Nineteenth to Twentieth Centuries;;;3;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;ASRC2674;GOVT2747;JWST2674;NES2674;;;This course examines major trends in the evolution of the Middle East in the modern era. Focusing on the 19th and 20th centuries and ending with the  "Arab Spring," we will consider Middle East history with an emphasis on five themes: imperialism, nationalism, modernization, Islam, and revolution.  Readings will be supplemented with translated primary sources, which will form the backbone of class discussions.
HIST2710;;;Introduction to the History of Medicine;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;BSOC2071;STS2071;;;This course offers an introductory survey of the history of medicine (principally in Europe and the United States) from classical antiquity to the early twentieth century. Using a combination of both primary and secondary sources, students will learn about the "Hippocratic Heritage" of contemporary western medicine; medicine in late antiquity; faith and healing in the medieval period; medicine and knowledge in the Islamic world; medicine during the Renaissance (particularly the rise of the mechanical philosophy); medicine in the age of Enlightenment; professionalization, women-doctors and midwives, and battles over 'quackery' in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries; the role of medicine in colonialism and empire; and the promises and perils of modern medicine (dramatic decreases in mortality on the one hand, the rise of Eugenics and the importance of Medicine to the National Socialist State on the other). As well as this temporal survey, we will consider a number of ongoing themes: race, bodily difference, and medicine; medicine and the environment; women, gender, and medicine; the history of the body; the history of sexuality; and the close connections between forms of social order and forms of medical knowledge. The course meets three times a week (for two lectures and a section) and is open to all.
HIST2711;;;Politics of Violence in Twentieth Century Europe;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;GOVT2716;JWST2711;;;This course provides a survey of Europe's 20th-century history with special emphasis on violence and its interpretation. Types of violence to be considered include warfare, terrorism, genocide, uprisings, and assassination, among others. Discussions of the First and Second World Wars and the political and ethnic clashes of the Cold War and decolonization will be supplemented by less familiar instances of violence in the European context. Lectures, readings and written assignments will focus on deciphering the various political motivations behind calls for and interpretations of violence.
HIST2750;;;History of Modern India;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;ASIAN2275;;;This introductory course is a broad survey of the history of the Indian subcontinent from remnants of the Mughal empire through the end of the British empire into the postcolonial present. Prominent themes include the emergence of nonviolent protest, religious and regional identities, ethnic rivalries, social reform and the "woman question," deindustrialization, nationalism and the place of democracy and militarism in a region that includes two nuclear powers, India and Pakistan.
HIST2760;;;The British Empire;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;;;;This course considers how a small northern European kingdom acquired and then governed a vast global empire. Beginning with the navigators, pirates and settlers of the Elizabethan era, and ending with the process of decolonization after World War Two, we will explore the diverse character and effects of British imperialism in the Americas, in Asia, in Africa, and the Pacific, and consider the legacies of the British empire in the contemporary world.
HIST2782;;;Film and US Foreign Policy;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;This course investigates the relationship between US foreign policy and film. We will examine how US films and the Hollywood film industry in particular have enacted, reinforced, and condemned US foreign policy, considering cases such as the Good Neighbor Policy's attempt to remake hemispheric relations, Hollywood's relationship to Nazi Germany, Cold War humanitarian and development films, documentaries criticizing US policies and programs, and recent collaborations between filmmakers and the CIA. Possible films screened include The Sheik, White Zombie, Our Daily Bread, Casablanca, The Magnificent Seven, and Zero Dark Thirty.
HIST2791;;;International Humanitarianism;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;;;;This course studies international humanitarian and human rights activites from their origins to the present. The ideological and social roots of humanitarian thought and action receive attention, as does the often-overlapping, sometimes conflictual relationship between humanitarianism and human rights advocacy. Case studies will include the anti-slavery movement, the activities of faith-based groups, biographical studies of pioneering individuals, and the international response to various genocides.
HIST2820;;;Science in Western Civilization: Newton to Darwin, Darwin to Einstein;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;BSOC2821;STS2821;;;This course aims to make comprehensible both to science majors and to students of the humanities the historical  structure and development of modern science and to show sciences as cultural phenomena. Changing perceptions of nature and human knowledge from Greek Antiquity to the twentieth century form the framework for current Western views of the world, while the roots of the present-day dominance of "science" as a symbol of progress and modernity lie in an alliance between knowledge of nature and power over nature that took shape in the nineteenth century after a long period of emergence. This course covers the eighteenth, nineteenth, and early twentieth centuries.  
HIST2860;;;The French Revolution;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;;;;In the turbulent and violent years from 1789 to 1815, France experienced virtually every form of government known to the modern world. This course explores the rapidly changing political landscape of this extraordinary period as well as the evolution of Revolutionary culture (the arts, theater, songs, fashion, the cult of the guillotine, attitudes towards gender and race). Whenever possible, we will use texts and images produced by the Revolutionaries themselves.
HIST2890;;;The Vietnamese Wars: 1945-1990;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;ASIAN2298;;;This course covers the three consecutive wars fought in Vietnam from 1945 to 1990 in which France, China, the US, and the USSR, among other countries, were directly involved. The course will endeavor to look at these wars from Vietnamese perspectives as well as from the perspectives of non-Vietnamese governments. One aspect of the course will be to contextualize these wars in the global arena of international relations and the foreign policies of various countries, in particular of the United States. Another aspect will be to see how Vietnamese understood what the wars were about. How and why the events of these wars have been remembered and forgotten in the different countries involved will also be addressed.
HIST2986;;;Democracy and Discourse in Twentieth Century China;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;ASIAN2268;;;Chinese political culture has long been characterized by authoritarianism, from the time of the old imperial order up until the present Communist era. Yet the twentieth century in China witnessed a profound engagement with notions of democracy that was evident in the realms of both political discourse and political practice. This course will explore the many fascinating forms that this engagement took, from attempts to transform the Qing dynasty into a constitutional monarchy and Sun Yatsen's establishment of a short-lived republic, to May Fourth and Nationalist era debates on democracy, to movements for democratic change under Communist rule, such as the Democracy Wall Movement and the Tiananmen Square protests. The aim will be to reflect on how democracy as a political concept has been understood and used in a Chinese context and the nature of its relationship with Chinese culture.
HIST3002;;;Supervised Research - Undergraduate;;;2-4;;;Fall, spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;
HIST3031;;;Race and Revolution in the Americas: 1776-1900;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;AMST3032;ASRC3031;LATA3031;;;This course will examine the "age of democratic revolutions" in the Americas from the perspective of the Black Atlantic. During this momentous era, when European monarchies were successfully challenged and constitutional governments created, Blacks fomented their own American revolutions both in the outside of evolving "New World democracies." This course examines the black trajectory in British North America, Latin America, the French (especially Haiti,) the British and the Spanish Caribbean. The course begins with black participation in the U.S. independence War (1776-1781) and concludes with black (non-U.S.) participation in the independence wars against Spain. The course will also briefly address post-emancipation race relations in these American countries.
HIST3101;;;British History, from 1870 to the Present;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;;;;An introduction to British history in the twentieth century with a focus on political change. Topics will include: the growth of mass politics, democracy and the welfare state; the impact of world wars, imperialism and decolonization on domestic politics; and Britain's changing relations with the US and Europe.
HIST3140;;;U.S. in the World;;;4;;;Fall, summer.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;AMST3140;CAPS3140;;;Students examine the emergence of the United States as a world power in the twentieth century. The course focuses on the domestic sources of foreign policy and the assumptions of the major policy makers (Wilson through Clinton). Important themes include the American response to a revolutionary world since 1912, the role of American racial views in the making of foreign policy, and the increasingly dominant role of the president in the making of U.S. foreign policy.
HIST3160;;;American Political Thought from Madison to Malcolm X;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;AMST3665;GOVT3665;;;A survey of American political thought from the Eighteenth Century to the present.

The professor offers insightful historical and social context.
HIST3200;;;The Viking Age;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;MEDVL3200;;;This course aims to familiarize students with the history of Scandinavia, ca. 800-1100 ad. Although well known as a dramatic chapter in medieval history, this period remains enigmatic and often misunderstood. Our goal will be to set Norse history within its European context, observing similarities with processes elsewhere in the medieval world, the better to perceive what makes the Norse unique. We will examine the social, economic and political activities of the Norsemen in continental Scandinavia, in Western and Eastern Europe, and in the North Atlantic.
HIST3300;;;Japan from War to Prosperity;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;ASIAN3335;;;An interpretation of Japanese history from the late 1920s to present, emphasizing mobilization for total war and its continuing legacies, technology and organized capitalism, relations with the United States and Asian neighbors, social integration and exclusion, historical representation and consciousness, and political dynamics.
HIST3343;;;The History of the Present;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;GOVT3646;;;According to the philosopher Michel Foucault, we cannot understand what is going on "today" without undertaking a historical excavation of how the current universe of thought, discourse, and culture came about. This course seeks to put into practice Foucault's incentive to construct a "history of the present" by exploring some of the most important ideas that have shaped our present. Among other topics we will discuss authoritarianism, liberalism, constitutionalism, republicanism, Marxism, conservatism, fascism, terrorism, neoliberalism, colonialism, modernism, racism, human rights, feminism, and third-worldism. We will examine how these systems of thought originated, how they came to operate as mechanisms of power and knowledge, and how they presented certain categories and claims as natural, self-evident, or inevitable. Readings will include Hobbes, Rousseau, Madison, Burke, Tocqueville, Robespierre, Arendt, Marx, Hayek, Fanon, Beauvoir, Wittig, and Althusser. Lectures will be organized around the contextualization and the close readings of texts.
HIST3450;;;Cultural and Intellectual Life of Nineteenth Century Americans;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;AMST3450;;;An examination of the development of cultural and intellectual diversity in the United States. Topics covered include: slavery and abolition; landscape and environment; religion; Darwinism; professionalization; literature; and the women's movement.
HIST3470;;;Asian American Women's History;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;AAS3470;AMST3470;FGSS3470;;;This course examines the experiences and representations of Asian American women from the mid-19th century to the present. It explores the lives and contexts of immigrant women and of women born in the U.S. Questions of identity and power are at the heart of this course as we investigate the intertwined nature of race, gender, and nation. We will also pay particular attention to the practice of history, seeking a better understanding of how scholars recover the history of a population rendered invisible by traditional methods and inquiries. Course materials include numerous primary sources in addition to scholarship from a variety of disciplines (history, literature, sociology, anthropology).
HIST3490;;;Renaissance England, 1485 - 1660;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;;;;If England from the time of Henry VIII to the beheading of Charles I is famous for its great cultural achievements, those achievements were products of and meditations upon a profound crisis of political and religious authority. This course considers the nature of that crisis and responses to it in the realms of imaginative literature, practical politics and revolutionary polemic. We will examine the impact of the Protestant Reformation and Puritanism, cultural assumptions surrounding kingship and tyranny, the construction of a rhetoric of political dissent around issues of sexuality and corruption, competing understandings of the social order and social control, political and religious radicalism during the English Revolution and the beginnings of modern scientific and political thought.
HIST3510;;;Machiavelli;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;ITAL3510;MEDVL3510;;;This course presents Machiavelli in a variety of historical and interpretive contexts; European and Italian politics in the early sixteenth century; the decline of the Florentine republic and the rise of the Medicean principate; Machiavelli's career in government and his, and the republic's, crisis in 1512-13; the intellectual traditions of Renaissance humanism, political thought, and the revival of antiquity; vernacular literary currents and popular culture; and the political writers and theorists with whom Machiavelli associated and corresponded. Emphasis is placed on a close reading of the major works (including the letters, The Prince, the Discourses, Mandragola, and selections from The Art of War and the Florentine Histories, all in translation) and a critical examination, in the light of that reading, of some major modern interpretations of Machiavelli.
HIST3515;;;The Asian American Middle Class;;;4;;;;;;;;;;;;AAS3515;;;
HIST3531;;;Daoist Traditions;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;ASIAN3332;CAPS3531;RELST3531;;;This course will examine the modes of philosophical and spiritual inquiry, varieties of spiritual/bodily cultivation and practice, and religious organizations and movements in China that we know as Daoist (or "Taoist"). We will review debates around the labeling of these ideas and practices. We will examine the ways in which Daoism was used to contest or legitimate imperial political power, and how the procedures and ideologies of the imperial state in turn informed Daoist theory and practice. Throughout, we will consider the ways in which standard modern western dichotomies, such as sacred/secular, spiritual/physical, and mind/body, break down when we try to apply them to the study of Daoism.
HIST3590;;;The Black Radical Tradition in the U.S.;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;AMST3590;ASRC3590;;;This course provides a critical historical interrogation of what Black Marxism author Cedric Robinson called "the Black Radical Tradition." It is designed to introduce students to some of the major currents in the history of black radical thought, action and organizing, with an emphasis on the United States after World War I. It relies on social, political and intellectual history to examine the efforts of black people who have sought not merely social reform, but a fundamental restructuring of political, economic and social relations. We will define and evaluate radicalism in the shifting contexts of liberation struggles. We will explore dissenting visions of social organization and alternative definitions of citizenship, progress and freedom. We will confront the meaning of the intersection of race, gender, class and sexuality in social movements.
HIST3700;;;History of the Holocaust;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;JWST3700;;;This course will analyze the meaning of the Holocaust from three vantage points: that of European history; that of Jewish history; and that of those states and religious institutions that shared responsibility by having stood by in silence.  Topics include:  the  evolution of modern anti-Semitism, the role of anti-Semitism in the Nazi ideology and program; the bureaucratization of death; Jewish life in ghettos and concentration  camps; the fate of Jews in occupied Europe and the question collaboration; Jewish political behavior under duress; the responses of the Western allies and the Churches; contemporary interpretations of the Holocaust and the meaning of evil.
HIST3710;;;World War II in Europe;;;4;;;Fall, summer.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;;;;The Second World War remains the single most important set of events shaping the contemporary world. The course deals with both the events of World War II as they shaped European and world history and the way those events were remembered and commemorated in postwar years. Lectures, screenings, and readings will examine: the role of wartime political leaders and military commanders; the experience of war and occupation for soldiers and civilians, including Resistance movements and collaborators; Nazi genocide; intellectual and cultural changes during the war, including the impact on literature and philosophy; strategic questions about the origins and conduct of the war; the concluding phases involving the Nuremberg Trials, the Yalta and Potsdam conferences, and the launching of the Cold War; and the representation of the war in subsequent films, literature, and political culture.
HIST3740;;;America Becomes Modern: The Gilded Age and Progressive Era;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;AMST3744;;;"America Becomes Modern" offers an upper-level survey of major themes in American history between 1877 and 1917. The course will have a lecture/discussion format; student participation is highly valued and encouraged. The last two decades of the 19th century and the first two of the twentieth marked an abrupt shift in the life experiences of the American people. Daily life changed radically from 1877-1920, as the agrarian republic gave way to an urbanizing consumer society. Debates about "progress" characterized the period, as new technologies, new peoples, new forms of politics and culture, and new patterns of living transformed the United States. This course will explore the political, economic, diplomatic and cultural history of the Gilded age and Progressive eras, focusing on the ways American tried to make sense of, to order, to moralize and to shape rapid change.
HIST3760;;;African American Social History, from 1910 to the Present: Race, Work, and the City;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;AMST3860;ASRC3860;ILRLR3860;LAW7060;;;Examines the experience of black Americans from the start of the Great Migration just before World War I. Topics include the effects of migration on work experiences and unionization patterns, the impact of depression and two world wars on black social structure and economic status, the growth of the Civil Rights movement, and the impact of migration and urbanization on a variety of social and cultural institutions.
HIST3790;;;The First World War: Causes, Conduct, Consequences;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;;;;This course examines the long-term and immediate political, social, and cultural causes of World War I, its catastrophic prosecution, and its revolutionary consequences. Recurring themes are: the building of nation-states, the diplomatic and military systems of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, mass mobilization, the development of mass violence, and the emergence of millenarian visions of the future.
HIST3800;;;Latinos in U.S. History;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;AMST3830;LSP3800;;;How would our understanding of U.S. History change if we began the national narrative in 16th century New Mexico rather than 17th century Virginia? What does U.S. history look like when examined as hemispheric history? What if we were to bring the periphery to the center and examine U.S. History from the vantage point of the colonized and the immigrant, the exile and the transnational? This course seeks to reframe U.S. history by reconstituting what we understand as "American" history. We will examine territorial expansion and empire, migration and nation building, industrialization and labor, war and revolution, and citizenship and transnationalism in the "American experience" broadly defined to include americanos of Spanish, Mexican, Caribbean, and Central/South American ancestries.
HIST3845;;;The Progressive Era: Work, Law, and Politics;;;4;;;;;;;;;;;;AMST3845;ILRLR3845;;;

HIST4030;;;History of the United States Senate;;;4;;;Fall, spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;AMST4218;GOVT4218;;;This course will offer students an opportunity to view the process of shaping national debates from the perspective of the United States Senate. The modern Senate will serve as the point of reference for an inquiry into the development of the institution's powers under the Constitution during the past 200 years. Class readings, lectures and discussions will focus on the themes of continuity and change, the role of individual senators, and the institutional evolution of the Senate. In addition to general class reading and written examinations, each student will write a short paper and participate in an oral presentation.
HIST4160;;;Gender and Sexuality in Southeast Asia;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ASIAN4416;ASIAN6618;FGSS4160;FGSS6160;HIST6160;LGBT4160;LGBT6160;;;Students consider the relationships among colonialism and gender and sexual identity formation in Southeast Asia. Using material from a wide range of fields including anthropology and literature, the course complicates the simplistic East/West and male/female binary. Each year the course is offered, its emphasis shifts to adapt to changes in the fields of gender, sexuality and Asian Studies. It incorporates theoretical literature and content that is broader than that of Southeast Asia.
HIST4221;;;The British in India, 1750-1830;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;;;;Examines the growth of British power in India before 1830.  Topics include: the sequence and causes of historical conquests, the British-Indian army, colonial legal regimes and knowledge systems, and the social life of colonial towns.  Students will undertake their own research paper on a topic of their choice.
HIST4232;;;Perspectives in Intellectual History: Modernity, Cataclysm and the Jews (1880-1930);;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;GERST4231;GERST6231;HIST6232;JWST4230;JWST6230;ROMS4230;ROMS6230;;;Between the end of the nineteenth century and the second World War, the Jewish intellectual appears as a new figure of European societies, quickly becoming a major actor in public spheres.  During those years, the Jewish intellectual becomes a privileged object of investigations, definitions and fantasies -- including anti-Semitic stereotypes -- for literature and popular culture, sociology and medicine or law, deeply shaping national mentalities and imagination.  A considerable iconography, from painting to political propaganda and illustrated magazines, sketches his real or invented profile.  As an incarnation of urbanity, mobility, extraterritoriality, textuality and rational thought, the Jewish intellectual turns out to be a mirror of modernity, eliciting a strong conservative rejection.  Lasting from the Dreyfus Affair to the Nazi burning of books in 1933, and focusing on three national contexts -- France, Germany and Italy -- the course tries to explore the history of this collective representation through its multiple expressions, both textual and visual.
HIST4233;;;The Holocaust in Postwar Culture (1945-1961);;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;COML4415;COML6415;FREN4415;FREN6415;GERST4411;GERST6411;GOVT4786;GOVT6786;HIST6233;JWST4410;JWST6415;ROMS4410;ROMS6410;;;There is an astonishing discrepancy between our perception of the Holocaust as a central event of the twentieth century and its marginal place in postwar culture.  It is during those years, nevertheless, that the destruction of European Jews aroused an intellectual debate whose philosophical, political, and literary contributions constitute landmarks for contemporary culture and criticism.  The course will explore the reasons for such a discrepancy, reconstructing the steps of the integration of the Holocaust into our historical consciousness.  It will analyze some of the most significant attempts to think such a trauma made by German-Jewish exiles (Arendt, Adorno, Anders), the survivors of the Nazi camps (Amery, Levi, Celan, Antelme), as well as the public intellectuals on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean (Sartre, Bataille, MacDonald, etc).
HIST4234;;;Melancholy Left:Marx to Benjamin;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;COML4416;COML6416;FREN4435;FREN6435;GERST4431;GERST6431;GOVT4696;GOVT6696;HIST6234;ROMS4430;ROMS6430;;;The fall of "real socialism" in 1990 put an end to the experience of twentieth century Marxism.  Its ideas, debates and controversies could be viewed-historicized and revisited-in a different light.  The defeated revolutions of the past century put into question a teleological vision of history, engendering the decline of Marxist historiography and the simultaneous appearance of memory, a previously ignored concept for interpreting the past.  Outlining a symbolic shift from Marx to Benjamin, this change has a melancholic flavor that permeates many expressions of contemporary Left culture (from movies and autobiographies to historical and philosophical essays).  On the other hand, the emergence of Postcolonialism reopened the debate on the Eurocentric roots of Marx's thought and stimulated a new approach to some classical Marxist thinkers and historians such as Gramsci and C.L.R. James.  Taking into account both classical and contemporary texts, the seminar will analyze a reconfigured relationship between history and memory in the Left culture of our post-utopian age.
HIST4291;;;Marriage and Divorce in Africa;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;ASRC4291;FGSS4291;;;Marriage was the widely expected norm within African societies. The institution was an important marker of adulthood, linking individuals and lineages in a network of mutual cooperation and support. Marriage practices and the concomitant gender expectations varied significantly between societies, and over time. As a result, marriage and divorce are especially rich terrain for exploring social history, women's agency, discursive constructions of 'women', masculinity and gender relations of power. This course explores some of the newest scholarship on marriage by Africanist scholars. The readings demonstrate the wide cultural variety in marriage as well as the dynamic relationship between marriage and historical change. They especially highlight women's roles and expectations in marriage, masculinity and the ways men and women negotiated the rules and boundaries of marriage.

HIST4373;;;Building Tomorrow: State Building and the Post-Colonial Moment;;;4;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HIST4375;;;Cultures of Modernization and Development;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;;;;In the 1950s and 1960s, social scientists devised a set of theories to diagnose underdevelopment in the Third World and prescribe a universal path to modernization for underdeveloped people, communities, and nations. Looking at case studies such as the Green Revolution, the 1960s Peace Corps, and microcredit, this course explores the rise of modernization and development in the post-World War II world.
HIST4390;;;Reconstruction and the New South;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;AMST4039;ASRC4390;ASRC6391;HIST6391;;;This course focuses on the American South in the nineteenth century as it made the transition from Reconstruction to new forms of social organization and patterns of race relations. Reconstruction will be considered from a sociopolitical perspective, concentrating on the experiences of the freed people. The New South emphasis will include topics on labor relations, economic and political changes, new cultural alliances, the rise of agrarianism, and legalization of Jim Crow.
HIST4393;;;The Underground Railroad and the Coming of the Civil War;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;AMST4393;ASRC4393;HIST6393;;;In 1850 American politicians banded together cross-regionally, passed a Fugitive Slave Law and breathed a sigh of relief, thinking they had once again dodged the slavery issue that threatened disunion. This "Bloodhound Bill" was designed to make "slave" catchers of all Northern whites. Instead it set in motion waves of protests, transformed previously silent whites into underground conductors, further emboldened veteran underground workers and forced thousands of self emancipated Northern blacks to emigrate. The Underground Railroad contributed to convincing Southerners that the Government would not or could not protect slavery. This course examines underground activism beginning in 1850 and offers an interpretation of how the Underground Railroad led to emancipation. The ebbs and flows of underground activity; transnational networks; Civil War military and geo-political issues; and what W.E.B. DuBois called the "General Strike" all contributed to making the Thirteenth Amendment a foregone conclusion.
HIST4460;;;Strategy in World War II;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;;;;Strategic decision-making in World War II. The course will be organized into a "task force" addressing crucial problems faced by the European-American Allies in World War II: the invasion of northwest Europe, strategic bombing tactics, the rescue of European Jews, and coordination with the Soviet Union. Individual presentations/papers followed by meetings to draft group reports.
HIST4522;;;Geopolitics of Europe's East: 1700-Present;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;NES4622;;;Two places have dominated the headlines over the past year: Ukraine and Syria/Iraq. Both have deep roots in the history of the Ottoman Empire's slow diminution and Russia's expansion starting in the 18th century. This course will examine different perspectives on a period when Eastern and Southeastern Europe were at the center of a contest between competing empires and emerging nation-states. Readings will be mostly primary sources by Russian, Polish, Turkish, Greek, Ukrainian, Arab, Bulgarian, German and other authors. Themes will include the emergence of pan-Slavism and pan-Turanism, federative schemes, how ideologies such as fascism and communism influenced interstate relations, and the cultural progeny (literature, art, music, etc.) of visions for a future regional order.
HIST4544;;;WWI & the Emergence of the Modern Middle East;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;HIST6544;NES4641;NES6641;;;It is hard to think of a region in the world that changed more drastically during the course of World War I, than that of the Middle East. For the war not only spelled the end of an empire that had united the region for well over 400 years, but it also meant the creation of new national borders, new state structures, colonial occupation, the entrenchment of settler colonialism, and a drastic upheaval in traditional socio-cultural orders. Despite the important role that the Ottoman Empire played in the war, and the deep and long-lasting impact the war had on the region, academic interests in the Great War has mostly focused on European experiences. This seminar, which will be offered in conjunction with a number of events taking place on campus, will turn the spotlight onto this important topic. Even though classic texts will be used in this seminar, the focus will be on newer scholarship dealing with the social and political history of the Ottoman Empire on the eve of the war, the experience of the war on the frontline and at home in the Middle East, and the impact of the war on the region in the first half of the 20th century. Thematically, the course will focus on trials of imperialism at the end of the 19th century, the study of the emergence of new forms of complex identifications in the region, the long-term impact of colonialism, and the emergence of nationalism. A basic background in the history of the region is strongly preferred, but not required.
HIST4614;;;Seminar in Early Islamic History: The Emergence of Islam: 600-750;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;NES4618;RELST4618;;;An examination of Islamic history from 600-750, with special attention to historiography and interpretive issues. Topics to be discussed will include: Arabia and the Near East before Islam; the collection of the Qur'an, the biography of Muhammad, the Arab conquests, the Umayyad caliphs, and the Abbasid takeover.
HIST4642;;;Women in the Modern Middle East;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;FGSS4640;NES4642;;;The primary emphasis of this discussion seminar is the historical development of gendered identities and the fluid manner in which different Middle Eastern communities responded to shifting ideas of sexuality, reproduction, and the family. Our focus of inquiry will be on themes that involve and relate to women, both directly and indirectly. We will particularly examine how and why women's status differs from one Middle Eastern country or region to another. From both theoretical and topical points of view, we will consider some of the most recent literature about women and gender. Since this is a history course, we will also examine how women's roles, as well as gendered systems and institutions, have changed over time.
HIST4661;;;Contested Continents: The Great War for Empire in North America and Beyond, 1754-1763;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;AMST4661;;;This senior research seminar offers students the opportunity to engage the vibrant history of the Great War for Empire (also known as the Seven Year's War, and the French and Indian War) from multiple perspectives.  In addition to the national and imperial categories traditionally employed in studies of the conflict, the course will also attend to its transnational character.  How did a war originating in a border dispute in what is now western Pennsylvania ultimately result in nearly one million battlefield deaths on four continents and in three oceans?  Should this be understood as the first "world war?" What was the impact of the war on the subsequent history of North America and the wider world?  Students will approach such questions from a variety of disciplinary approaches, including military history, the mobilization of economic resources, center-periphery political relations, and the involvement of indigenous nations - with an eye toward assessing the long-term consequences of the war and its enduring, complex, and contested legacy in popular memory (particularly the recently-completed 250th anniversary commemoration).  The course will emphasize critical interpretation of a rich array of primary documents and published scholarship, and each student will complete an independent research essay based on original sources.
HIST4680;;;Love and Sex in the Italian Renaissance;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;ITAL4680;MEDVL4680;;;An exploration of literary representations of love, sex, and eros in Renaissance Italy and attempts by secular governments and the Church to manage, discipline, and punish sexual transgression. Primary texts include Boccaccio's Decameron; selected fifteenth-century novelle; plays by Machiavelli (Mandragola, Clizia), Bibbiena (Calandria) and Pietro Aretino (The Master of the Horse); Giulia Bigolina's novel Urania; and Moderata Fonte's dialogue The Worth of Women. Secondary readings include studies of sexual crime, love across class boundaries, homosexuality, and lesbianism.
HIST4701;;;Africa in the African American Mind;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;AMST4701;ASRC4701;;;This seminar examines some of the political and cultural visions of Africa and Africans held by African-American intellectuals and activists in the 19th and 20th centuries. Emphasis is placed on the philosophies of black nationalism, Pan Africanism and anticolonialism and the themes of emigration, expatriation, repatriation and exile. Awareness of Africa and attitudes toward the continent and its peoples have profoundly shaped African-American identity, culture and political consciousness. Notions of a linked fate between Africans and black Americans have long influenced black life and liberation struggles within the U.S. The motives, purposes and outlooks of African-American theorists who have claimed political, cultural, or spiritual connection to Africa and Africans have varied widely, though they have always powerfully reflected black experiences in America and in the West. The complexity and dynamism of those views belie simplistic assumptions about essential or "natural" relationships, and invite critical contemplation of the myriad roles that Africa has played in the African-American mind."
HIST4751;;;Science, Race, and Colonialism;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;STS4751;;;This course is divided into three major thematic sections. The first looks at the history of racial thinking in the West. We begin with the existence (or not) of conceptions of biological race in the early- modern period, focusing on early voyages of discovery and so-called "first encounters" between the peoples of the Old and New Worlds.  In the second part of the course we will look at early enunciations of racial thought in the late 18th century and at the problems of classification that these raised, before examining the roots of "Scientific Racism." We close with a look at Darwin, Social Darwinism, and eugenics movements in different national contexts.  The last third of the course looks at science and technology in colonial contexts, including "colonial technologies" (guns, steam- ships, and telegraphs) as well as medicine and public hygiene.
HIST4825;;;Change in Late Antiquity;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;CLASS4625;CLASS6625;HIST6825;RELST4825;;;In the fourth century C.E. the Roman emperors decided to favor Christianity and shortly thereafter to forbid non-Christian activity. The 'end of paganism' however did not occur all at once if it ever did. This seminar will focus on the approaches to the problem of Christianization and on its documentation. Through readings and discussion, we will chart the transformations of the Roman world from 250 to 600 C.E.
HIST4851;;;Refugees;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;AMST4851;LSP4851;;;Since World War II, over 4 million people have migrated to the United States as refugees. In this seminar we will examine some of these refugee migrations and the ways these migrations challenged our understanding of the United States as a "haven for the oppressed." We will examine the crafting of refugee/asylum policy, the role of nongovernmental actors in influencing policy, and the ways policy reflected foreign-policy interests and security concerns. The last weeks of the course will pay particular attention to our changing definitions of who 'merits' asylum in the United States since the end of the Cold War.
HIST4910;;;Approaches to Medieval Violence;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;HIST6920;MEDVL4910;MEDVL6910;;;'Violence' has become an unavoidable - and urgently troubling - buzzword in contemporary Western culture. We worry about its manifestations and representations in our own civilization, we scan foreign societies with which we interact for any sign of it, we fantasize about consummating it or construct our utopias around its absence. This course is intended as an opportunity for students working on a variety of topics, periods and areas in premodern Europe to investigate its relevance to their own studies. Through an examination of readings on violence in particular historical contexts, from Late Antiquity to the Early Modern period, we will seek to elicit reflection on what is meant by the concept, to prompt consideration of distinctions among forms of violence, and to sample a variety of analytical approaches and tools.  Graduate Students should sign up for HIST 6920.
HIST4945;;;The Birth of the Prison in Eighteenth Century Europe and America;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;HIST6945;;;In medieval and renaissance Europe, criminals were fined, branded, or executed; after the 18th century, more of them went to jail. For some observers, the birth of the prison was a triumph of humanitarian compassion. For others, they marked an ominous new form of social control.  In this course look at why and how prisons emerged during the 18th and early 19th centuries in Europe and America.  What were prisons like, how did newfangled  "Enlightenment" ideas about punishment and poverty affect penal reformers, how did the new prisons compare to other institutions of confinement (plague hospitals, mental asylums, bridewells), and how did prisoners exercise agency?
HIST4963;;;China's Early Modern;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;ASIAN4461;ASIAN6661;CAPS4963;HIST6963;;;Theories of modernization have inspired, informed, and plagued the historiography of late imperial China.  Comparative studies have variously found and sought to explain in the Song-Qing eras an absence of modernization, modernization earlier than Europe's, or alternative paths of modernization. Regional models argue for trans-East Asian systems and patterns of modernization. Global models have argued that China had a vital role in Europe's modernization as a provenance of modernizing institutions and ideas, as a source of exploited resources, or otherwise as an integral part of global systems. In this course we will explore these historiographical debates and develop critical perspectives, including approaches to escaping Eurocentric and teleological frameworks.
HIST6000;;;Graduate Research Seminar;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;This seminar is devoted entirely to the writing of a substantive research paper. Students will share research proposals, annotated bibliographies, outlines and portions of rough drafts. Class meetings will be devoted to discussing what students have produced, and general issues associated with constructing research papers.
HIST6005;;;Graduate History Colloquium;;;4;;;Fall, spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;This seminar-style colloquium provides an opportunity for intellectual exchange across all the fields of History and related disciplines. Each week, a graduate student will pre-circulate an article-length essay or dissertation chapter, to be read and commented upon by the participants and then to be discussed at the colloquium. The aim is to create a lively, critical, secure space where graduate students can try out new ideas and approaches, offer and receive in-depth responses to fresh work, and gain insight into current professional practices.
HIST6081;;;Seminar in American Labor History;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;Prerequisite: graduate standing and permission of instructor.;;;ILRLR7081;;;Topics change depending on semester and instructor.
HIST6130;;;Entangled Histories of the Americas and the Atlantic;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;In this seminar we will read and analyze some of the most recent approaches to the transnational (or transimperial) connections that characterized the lives of Atlantic dwellers. In assessing these entangled histories we will identify and question the sources of entanglement (where did the entanglement originate?), the geographic reach of the entanglement (was it Atlantic or pan-American in scope?), and the historiographical consequences of privileging certain types of entanglement (what does a historiographical map of the Atlantic tell us about the entangled nature of the histories of the Atlantic and the Americas? Is the map reflecting historical realities or the geographical spread of historians' fields of expertise?). The assigned readings will help us tackle these questions and to discuss key themes in transnational history like the spread of information across political boundaries, the transnational impacts of revolutionary movements, the participation of subalterns in transnational communication networks, and the emergence and evolution of cosmopolitanism.
HIST6160;;;Gender and Sexuality in Southeast Asia;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;ASIAN4416;ASIAN6618;FGSS4160;FGSS6160;HIST4160;LGBT4160;LGBT6160;;;Students consider the relationships among colonialism and gender and sexual identity formation in Southeast Asia. Using material from a wide range of fields including anthropology and literature, the course complicates the simplistic East/West and male/female binary. Each year the course is offered, its emphasis shifts to adapt to changes in the fields of gender, sexuality and Asian Studies. It incorporates theoretical literature and content that is broader than that of Southeast Asia.
HIST6232;;;Perspectives in Intellectual History: Modernity, Cataclysm and the Jews (1880-1930);;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;GERST4231;GERST6231;HIST4232;JWST4230;JWST6230;ROMS4230;ROMS6230;;;Between the end of the nineteenth century and the second World War, the Jewish intellectual appears as a new figure of European societies, quickly becoming a major actor in public spheres.  During those years, the Jewish intellectual becomes a privileged object of investigations, definitions and fantasies -- including anti-Semitic stereotypes -- for literature and popular culture, sociology and medicine or law, deeply shaping national mentalities and imagination.  A considerable iconography, from painting to political propaganda and illustrated magazines, sketches his real or invented profile.  As an incarnation of urbanity, mobility, extraterritoriality, textuality and rational thought, the Jewish intellectual turns out to be a mirror of modernity, eliciting a strong conservative rejection.  Lasting from the Dreyfus Affair to the Nazi burning of books in 1933, and focusing on three national contexts -- France, Germany and Italy -- the course tries to explore the history of this collective representation through its multiple expressions, both textual and visual.
HIST6233;;;The Holocaust in Postwar Culture (1945-1961);;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;COML4415;COML6415;FREN4415;FREN6415;GERST4411;GERST6411;GOVT4786;GOVT6786;HIST4233;JWST4410;JWST6415;ROMS4410;ROMS6410;;;There is an astonishing discrepancy between our perception of the Holocaust as a central event of the twentieth century and its marginal place in postwar culture.  It is during those years, nevertheless, that the destruction of European Jews aroused an intellectual debate whose philosophical, political, and literary contributions constitute landmarks for contemporary culture and criticism.  The course will explore the reasons for such a discrepancy, reconstructing the steps of the integration of the Holocaust into our historical consciousness.  It will analyze some of the most significant attempts to think such a trauma made by German-Jewish exiles (Arendt, Adorno, Anders), the survivors of the Nazi camps (Amery, Levi, Celan, Antelme), as well as the public intellectuals on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean (Sartre, Bataille, MacDonald, etc).
HIST6234;;;Melancholy Left: Marx to Benjamin;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;COML4416;COML6416;FREN4435;FREN6435;GERST4431;GERST6431;GOVT4696;GOVT6696;HIST4234;ROMS4430;ROMS6430;;;The fall of "real socialism" in 1990 put an end to the experience of twentieth century Marxism. Its ideas, debates and controversies could be viewed-historicized and revisited-in a different light. The defeated revolutions of the past century put into question a teleological vision of history, engendering the decline of Marxist historiography and the simultaneous appearance of memory, a previously ignored concept for interpreting the past. Outlining a symbolic shift from Marx to Benjamin, this change has a melancholic flavor that permeates many expressions of contemporary Left culture (from movies and autobiographies to historical and philosophical essays). On the other hand, the emergence of Postcolonialism reopened the debate on the Eurocentric roots of Marx's thought and stimulated a new approach to some classical Marxist thinkers and historians such as Gramsci and C.L.R. James. Taking into account both classical and contemporary texts, the seminar will analyze a reconfigured relationship between history and memory in the Left culture of our post-utopian age.
HIST6330;;;Topics in Ancient Greek History;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;CLASS7684;;;Topic for Spring 2015: Narrative and Ancient History.  We will look at the theory and practice of narrative history in the study of the ancient Greek and Roman worlds and their neighbors. Topics include: microhistory, family, sex, battle, murder, riot and revolt.
HIST6332;;;Seminar in Digital Humanities;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;AMST6332;;;This course will survey emerging digital humanities techniques, scholarship, and theory. We will cover the history of humanities computing, text-mining, "big data" questions, geographic information systems, collaborative projects and digital publishing, topic modeling, and other issues.  This workshop-style course will focus on acquiring new skills for research and analysis, building the scholarly literature, discussing theoretical implications, and applying theory and skills in individual and group research. Texts will be drawn from scholarship in history, literary criticism, and related fields.
HIST6391;;;Reconstruction and the New South;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;AMST4039;ASRC4390;ASRC6391;HIST4390;;;This course focuses on the American South in the nineteenth century as it made the transition from Reconstruction to new forms of social organization and patterns of race relations. Reconstruction will be considered from a sociopolitical perspective, concentrating on the experiences of the freed people. The New South emphasis will include topics on labor relations, economic and political changes, new cultural alliances, the rise of agrarianism, and legalization of Jim Crow.
HIST6393;;;The Underground Railroad and the Coming of the Civil War;;;4;;;;;;;;;;;;AMST4393;ASRC4393;HIST4393;;;In 1850 American politicians banded together cross-regionally, passed a Fugitive Slave Law and breathed a sigh of relief, thinking they had once again dodged the slavery issue that threatened disunion. This "Bloodhound Bill" was designed to make "slave" catchers of all Northern whites. Instead it set in motion waves of protests, transformed previously silent whites into underground conductors, further emboldened veteran underground workers and forced thousands of self emancipated Northern blacks to emigrate. The Underground Railroad contributed to convincing Southerners that the Government would not or could not protect slavery. This course examines underground activism beginning in 1850 and offers an interpretation of how the Underground Railroad led to emancipation. The ebbs and flows of underground activity; transnational networks; Civil War military and geo-political issues; and what W.E.B. DuBois called the "General Strike" all contributed to making the Thirteenth Amendment a foregone conclusion.
HIST6472;;;The Problem with Rights;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;AMST6472;COML6472;FGSS6472;GOVT6776;LGBT6472;;;In June 2013, in the space of a week, the Supreme Court ruled on affirmative action, the legacy of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, and the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). While the first two decisions were perceived as a step back in the fight against racial discrimination, the repeal of DOMA was welcomed by mainstream LGBT-rights organizations as a decisive move towards equality. One of the goals of this seminar is to think these rulings together instead of treating them as separate entities. How did the struggle for sexual rights and the promotion of color blindness come to coexist so easily within the law? In order to understand how liberalism has operated historically and theoretically as a crucial site of regulation for sexuality and race, we will read texts from a wide range of contexts and disciplines including political theory, anthropology, literature, philosophy, history, and law. Readings will include "classic" critics of liberalism such as Marx, Nietzsche, Althusser, and Foucault, and contemporary authors such as Wendy Brown, Elizabeth Povinelli, Lisa Duggan, David Eng, Janet Halley, Katherine Franke, and Jasbir Puar, among others.
HIST6482;;;History/Geography/Theory;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;LATA6482;;;This seminar is a readings course on works from the past two decades that have wrestled theoretically, empirically, and narratively with the boundary between geography and history. The course is purposefully promiscuous, temporally and spatially, and the readings traverse wide swaths of time and space. Topics to be covered may include mapping, surveying, and exploration; the production of space; histories of property and enclosure; non-state spaces and counter-territorialities; development and 'nature'; and spatial subjectivities.
HIST6544;;;WWI & the Emergence of the Modern Middle East;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;HIST4544;NES4641;NES6641;;;It is hard to think of a region in the world that changed more drastically during the course of World War I, than that of the Middle East.  For the war not only spelled the end of an empire that had united the region for well over 400 years, but it also meant the creation of new national borders, new state structures, colonial occupation, the entrenchment of settler colonialism, and a drastic upheaval in traditional socio-cultural orders.  Despite the important role that the Ottoman Empire played in the war, and the deep and long-lasting impact the war had on the region, academic interests in the Great War has mostly focused on European experiences.  This seminar, which will be offered in conjunction with a number of events taking place on campus, will turn the spotlight onto this important topic. Even though classic texts will be used in this seminar, the focus will be on newer scholarship dealing with the social and political history of the Ottoman Empire on the eve of the war, the experience of the war on the frontline and at home in the Middle East, and the impact of the war on the region in the first half of the 20th century.  Thematically, the course will focus on trials of imperialism at the end of the 19th century, the study of the emergence of new forms of complex identifications in the region, the long-term impact of colonialism, and the emergence of nationalism.  A basic background in the history of the region is strongly preferred, but not required.
HIST6609;;;History of Liberalism;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;This graduate seminar will explore the origin and character of liberal political thought in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. We will read classic liberal texts as well as recent histories of liberalism. While the focus will be mainly on European thinkers, we will also consider the relationship between liberalism and imperialism, and the global spread of liberal ideas.
HIST6625;;;Race, Slavery, and Revolution: France and the Caribbean Colonies;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;ASRC6625;;;Hundreds of thousands of slaves were shipped from Africa to the islands of the French West Indies to satisfy Europe's insatiable demand for sugar and coffee. While French colonies in the Caribbean were profoundly important to France and the global economy of the eighteenth century, they were largely ignored by later historians. In recent years, however, some of the most exciting and controversial new research has focused on the culture and society of the French Caribbean and the relationship between the colonies and Europe, transforming our understanding of both.
HIST6640;;;Approaches to Modern Chinese History;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;ASIAN6641;;;This graduate seminar examines developments in the field of modern Chinese history from the postwar to the present. Through the critical reading of scholarship both classic and contemporary, we will familiarize ourselves with the main historiographical debates that have shaped the field, and think through the process and politics in the writing of modern Chinese history. We will also discuss ways that these debates can be brought into the classroom for undergraduate teaching. In addition, students will work together with the instructor to design research projects of their own, and to situate these in the driving questions of the field. Background knowledge of modern Chinese history required.
HIST6811;;;Aspects of Modern Japanese Thought;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;In this seminar, limited to graduate students with good reading knowledge of Japanese, we will read, discuss, and translate selections from modern Japanese thought, drawn from the period between the Meiji Restoration and the early years after World War II. Along the way, we will attempt to improve our translation skills.

Private sector firms are actively marketing transgenic crops and other products of biotechnology globally. The public sector has been somewhat less active, but is becoming increasingly involved in transgenic technologies, particularly in less-industrialized countries. Developmental questions begin with those we ask of all technology: at whose cost, to whose benefit? Social movements have arisen to block both the testing and commercializing of biotechnology products, arguing that the developmental consequences are negative. Their objections center on the issues of food sovereignty, effects of land use change on the environment, ownership of transgenic traits and the genetic background in which they are placed (intellectual property), environmental uncertainties/risks, control of the food supply by multinational corporations and human health issues. Students will evaluate the legitimacy of various arguments and political positions relative to scientific findings and cultural norms.

IARD7540;;;Water Management in an Era of Growing Water Scarcity;;;2-3;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;BEE7540;;;Scarcity of water might be well overtake climate change as the main issue limiting future development. In fact in many water-short areas in the world, such as the Mediterranean, much of Sub-Saharan Africa, and India, it is already a main cause of the prevailing poverty.   Management of water in water scarce regions demands tradeoffs between a wide range of goals: preservation or enhancement of the environment, enhancement of social equity, preservation of cultural identity, and economically efficient utilization of water.  Water management also requires consideration of a wide range of factors, some physical other socio/cultural, economic, legal, and political.

(It provides material that is distinct from that provided in ILRHR 6690 Managing Compensation.) Students will learn how to design a pay plan, including base pay and pay-for-performance plans. By the completion of the course, participants will know how to design pay ranges and grades for organizations where most jobs can be benchmarked with market data. The course will also devote considerable time to the design of incentive plans, including merit pay, bonuses, gainsharing, profit sharing, piece-rate, tipping, and commission systems. It is useful for those desiring employment as an entry-level compensation specialist, a HR generalist, those starting and running their own business, or those who want a better understanding of how HR practices are actually managed. For students with a particular interest in compensation, the course can be taken in addition to ILRHR 6690 (or other compensation courses available at Cornell); for those interested in compensation in the services industry, this course can be taken as a standalone course.
ILRHR4615;;;Socially Responsible Business;;;2;;;Spring. (Seven weeks);;;;;;;;;ILRHR6615;;;HR leaders are now being asked to lead the CSR function, to head the company foundation, or to create programs that engage employees in the community.  They are also asked to oversee compliance around corporate ethics, whistleblower provisions, and to help safeguard the company reputation.  This course will examine how corporations and non-profits are engaging in socially beneficial activities as well as how some have engaged in socially harmful activities.  The course begins with an overview of key regulatory and voluntary compliance regimens such as the Sarbanes Oxley Act, Dodd-Frank, Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, FASB regulations, and the conflict of interest and ethics policies of domestic and international corporations and non-profits.  We will then review the policies, programs, and cultures of certain corporations and non-profits that have allowed them to create strong and good reputations as well as examples of corporations that have engaged in fraudulent and unethical behavior.  We will discuss such diverse topics as impact investing by corporations, the excesses of executive compensation, bribery, product liability and operational debacles, and the role and value of good organizational reputations.  Some of the companies and countries we will focus on include:  Merck Corporation (US), Tata Corporation (India), Yara (Norway), Coca Cola (Mexico), Environmental Defense Fund (US), Accenture (US), Chiquita (South America).  Students will be evaluated on class participation, two short papers or projects, and a final exam.

ILRHR4655;;;Work, Family and Organizations;;;2;;;Spring. (7 weeks);;;;;;Prerequisite: ILRHR 2600.;;;;;;Work and family are two of the main institutions around which adults organize their lives.  In this course, we will analyze those institutions and their relationship to one another, unpacking the ways in which work and family do, or do not, support one another.  Specifically, we will explore the conflict between work and family, and its intersectionality with individual differences and social constructions, such as gender.  We will discuss challenges facing individuals, families, organizations, and society from both a theoretical and practical perspective.  Students will learn and discuss ways of addressing these challenges, with an emphasis on organizational policies and practices.
ILRHR4664;;;Human Resource Analytics;;;4;;;Fall or spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;Addresses the growing need for data-driven, analytical approaches to managing talent.

ILRHR5640;;;Human Resources Management in Effective Organizations;;;4;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ILRHR6400;;;Organizational Diversity and Inclusion;;;2;;;Fall or spring. (Seven weeks);;;;;;;;;;;;The diversity of the U.S. workforce has been steadily increasing over the last 50 years, and is projected to continue increasing significantly.  Although Title VII of the Civil Rights Act was passed in 1964 to prohibit employment discrimination based on an individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, and other employment legislation has since been passed to prohibit discrimination based on other group characteristics such as age and disability status, claims of discrimination have been on the rise. This suggests that much work remains to be done in organizations. The purpose of this course is to introduce you to current theory, research, and practice regarding discrimination and inclusion in the workplace.  We will begin by defining diversity and the multiple existing justifications for "managing diversity" within organizations. We will then examine bias within organizations, including its root cause in stereotyping and power differentials, and its manifestation in the implementation of HR practices, the treatment of employees, and in broader society. We will also explore the impact of demographic diversity on the functioning of work groups/teams, particularly as it relates to commonly made arguments about the "business case" for diversity.  We will spend some time discussing the role of HR and diversity practices in fostering inclusion, and the important role of an organization's climate and culture. Finally, we will begin to explore the role of leaders and change agents in fostering diversity and inclusion.
ILRHR6410;;;Disability Considerations in HR Policy and Practice;;;2;;;Spring. (Seven weeks);;;;;;;;;;;;Despite the two decades that have passed since the passage of the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act, individuals with disabilities continue to face numerous obstacles to gaining and maintaining employment within the U.S. workforce. We will begin the course with a discussion of the importance of this problem - for people with disabilities, employers, and for society at large - and then discuss employment legislation that has been passed in an effort to improve the employment of people with disabilities. A major component of this legislation has to do with reasonable accommodations, yet there continues to be insufficient understanding of what constitutes a reasonable accommodation and the likely costs associated with providing these accommodations, both of which we will cover in the third week of the course. We will then move into a discussion of human resource management topics related to the hiring, career development, and performance management of people with disabilities. We will spend the last week situating all of this within a broader discussion of diversity management in organizations, as people with disabilities have not consistently been included in the diversity agenda of organizations.
ILRHR6440;;;Forging the Future of Work in America;;;2;;;Spring. (Seven weeks);;;;;;Prerequisite: ILRHR 5600.;;;;;;This course is a local adaptation of a course developed and conducted by Professor Thomas Kochan at MIT's Sloan School. (#15.662) titled "How the Next Generation can Secure the American Dream". Both courses are part of a larger initiative motivated by the concern that those just now entering the workforce are inheriting a mess that, unless reversed, promises to deliver a future in which many, if not most, will experience a lower standard of living than their parents.  The initiative aims first to get a firm handle on the younger generation's definition of the "American Dream" and then to mobilize cross-generational efforts to secure the key components of the dream.  The MIT course employs "blended learning" (i.e., a mix of online and classroom experiences).  Thus, we have an opportunity to tap into the online portion of that course  asynchronously (i.e., week by week at our convenience) and subsequently use these resources as well as other related materials to guide and enrich our in-class discussions which will focus on the following topics: identifying current opportunities and challenges facing the U.S. workforce, clarifying the nature of the old (post WW II) social contract and the conditions that made it possible, understanding subsequent developments that have eroded the old contract, elucidating the seeds of a new approach, and, finally, forming plans to promote change toward forging a more desirable future of work in America.
ILRHR6600;;;HR Leadership: Views from the Top;;;2;;;Spring.;;;;;;Prerequisite: ILRHR 5600 or equivalent, graduate standing.;;;;;;Hands-on course offering students a unique opportunity to learn and develop key competencies required of HR leaders. The course will focus on developing an understanding of the role and responsibilities of modern HR leaders, and exploration of the key competencies tied to successful performance as an HR leader. The course will be taught in partnership with current or former Chief HR officers and will include the exploration of topics including setting and driving an HR strategy, coaching and influencing line leaders, setting and driving organizational culture, HR's role in mergers and acquisitions, and driving change. Students will apply learnings from lectures and readings to complete an individual project related to how they will make a positive impact as a leader in the organization that they will work for after the semester. The goal of the course is to provide students with a model of HR leadership, learning on key competencies, and a personal development plan to prepare themselves to become HR leaders.
ILRHR6604;;;Global Field Study in Strategic Human Resources;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;This unique course provides students with in-depth information on strategic HRM in a selected region of the world. Covers the development of selected businesses; the history, role, and current efforts of government in the workplace; and local cultural nuances as they affect the world of work.

The course includes guest speakers such as the founder of a major Indian non-profit organization, the president of a foundation, investment managers and other practitioners. The course has a mid-term and final exam along with 4 five-page papers on budgeting, financial analysis, fundraising, and a merger among several organizations.
ILRHR6606;;;Leadership Development in Organizations;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;Prerequisite: ILRHR 5600 or equivalent.;;;;;;David Whitwam, the former chairman, president, and CEO of Whirlpool Corporation was quoted as saying: "The thing that wakes me up in the middle of the night is not what might happen to the economy or what our competitors might do next. It is worrying about whether we have the leadership capacity and talent to implement the new and more complex global strategies." Evidence suggests that this concern is widely shared among business executives, and this course is designed to explore how organizations are currently meeting this challenge. Specifically, students are exposed to the methods and approaches that organizations use to identify, assess and develop high-potential talent and the means for evaluating these practices.
ILRHR6611;;;Entrepreneurs and Entrepreneurial Organizations;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;This course brings a social- science perspective to the study of entrepreneurs and entrepreneurial organizations in the United States, with a strong emphasis on the historical context and social institutions that enable and support entrepreneurial activity. Through modern and historical case studies, the course critically evaluates the received wisdom about entrepreneurs and entrepreneurial organizations. This course is intended for advanced undergraduate students and MILR students who are interested in learning more about entrepreneurship. It is not a "How to" course but rather a conceptual overview of entrepreneurship with particular emphasis on labor market and employment-related topics. Students will examine various forms of entrepreneurship, including self-employment, franchising, small and family businesses, high- technology ventures, and social entrepreneurship. An important concern of the course is how entrepreneurship is different for different categories of people, especially women and minorities.
ILRHR6615;;;Socially Responsible Business;;;2;;;Spring.

Students will be evaluated on class participation, two short papers or projects, and a final exam. 
ILRHR6616;;;Globalization and Human Resource Strategies;;;4;;;Fall or spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;The globalization of product, labor, and capital markets has led to profound changes in the competitive environment in which firms operate. Yet, these global economic forces are filtered through national institutions that offer unique sets of opportunities and constraints for multinational corporations doing business in different countries. Regional governance systems, such as the European Union, add another layer of complexity to the institutional environment in which firms operate; and governments at many levels are creating new regulatory rules in response to recent financial crises. The course examines how corporations respond to these environmental complexities, why they adopt different approaches to business and HR management, and whether alternative strategies affect important outcomes for firms, employees, and other stakeholders.
ILRHR6622;;;Compensation in Service Firms;;;3;;;Spring.;;;;;;Prerequisite: ILRHR 2600/ILRHR 5600.;;;HADM4820;HADM6820;ILRHR4612;;;Designed to give students a practical understanding of the methods and implications of compensation, including hands-on experience designing compensation systems for firms in the service industry.

ILRLR3065;;;Immigrant America: Race and Citizenship in Modern Working-Class History;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;AMST3065;LATA3065;LSP3065;;;Immigration discourse and policy has played a central role in shaping the modern American nation-state, including its composition, values, and institutions. This course begins in the late nineteenth century, defining it as a pivotal moment in U.S. immigration and labor history when efforts to regulate immigrant entry and naturalization became increasingly bureaucratized. As part of the course we will examine the causes and consequences of working-class migration to the United States from a comparative historical, ethno-racial, class-based, and gendered perspective. We will also address questions regarding the perceived benefit and cost of immigration at both the national and local (i.e., community) levels. In this sense, we will explore the economic, social, cultural, and political impact immigrants have had on the United States over time. Finally, we will consider how immigrants have negotiated the pressures of their new surroundings, and challenged dominant conceptions of American national identity and citizenship in the process.
ILRLR3068;;;Organizing for Immigrant Worker Rights;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;LSP3068;;;This class examines the institutional processes of enforcing immigrant worker rights. We begin by reviewing the legal foundations of immigrant labor, including the current immigration enforcement regime, and the role of legal status in labor standards enforcement protections.  We examine how organized labor has evolved with regards to immigrant workers, shifting from supporting employer sanctions in 1986, to repudiating them as a tool for employer control in 2001.  We then evaluate the role that immigrant workers have played in the revitalization of the labor movement, and the challenges that remain for unions.  Beyond unions, we examine the emergence of new forms of worker representation, including the varying types of worker centers.  We focus on the proliferation of day labor centers, and more recently, non-union efforts to organize workers in the restaurant industry.  We even consider the role of undocumented workers in the public sector, made possible through the increased use of subcontracting. We look at how public entities have turned to worker organizations to help hold employers accountable, and how workers have turned to local governments to strengthen worker protections (such as higher minimum wages and strengthened penalties for wage theft), as well as how states have become new targets for policy change  (such as recent victories for domestic workers).  We also discuss binational efforts to advance immigrant worker rights.  We end by considering prospects for federal immigration reform, and the implications these proposals may have for immigrant worker rights.
ILRLR3071;;;Governing Economic Development: The U.S. Experience;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;Surveys the history of U.S. Economic development from the perspective of the governance structures created to organize and control economic activity, emphasizing the changing regulatory roles of public and private institutions.

ILRLR3830;;;Workers' Rights as Human Rights;;;4;;;Fall or spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;This course, a distance learning endeavor with the International Labor Organization in Geneva, examines U.S. domestic labor law and policy using internationally accepted human rights principles as standards for judgment. Considers the idea of human rights, its philosophical and moral origins, and introduces the legal and social obligations of both governments and nonstate actors to respect the human rights of workers. Topics include the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, ILO International Labor Standards, the Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, workers' freedom of association and the right to organize and collectively bargain, occupational health and safety, discrimination, forced labor, child labor, migrant labor, labor rights defined in international trade agreements, the value judgments underlying labor policy choices, and the struggle for enforcement of human rights standards nationally and international. The course examines these topics in an internationally comparative context and includes presentations and discussions from international experts on various human rights issues.
ILRLR3835;;;Claiming Individual Worker Rights: Promises and Challenges;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;ILRLR6835;LSP3835;LSP6835;;;This course examines the experiences of workers attempting to navigate the labor standards enforcement bureaucracy. We begin by reviewing the conditions of post-industrial labor in an era of declining unionization and weak federal and state protections. Next we review theories of legal consciousness and legal mobilization, which help explain the conditions under which low-wage workers learn about their rights and come forward to demand justice.  We walk through claimsmaking in an array of federal and state administrative bureaucracies, including wage and hour, health and safety, and discrimination.  We also look at how the immigration enforcement regime intersects with the tenets of at-will employment to grant employers wide latitude in retaliating against undocumented workers and stifling attempts at legal mobilization.  We next assess how these formal protections are filtered through various institutional gatekeepers (including legal advocates and medical experts) and how organizational compliance structures (such as human resources and mediation programs) have limited worker's ability to make claims on their rights.  We consider how intersecting bases of inequality (such as gender, race, and national origin) are processed by administrative bureaucracies, and how lay versus legal conceptions of workplace justice often diverge.  We end by considering the fallout of workplace abuse on individuals and their families.

ILRLR4083;;;Contemporary Challenges in Workplace Law;;;2;;;;;;;;;;;;ILRLR6083;;;
ILRLR4580;;;The Science of Social Behavior;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;Prerequisite: At least one statistics course.;;;COMM4580;HD4580;SOC4580;;;This is a small capstone seminar for select seniors (and the occasional junior) who are interested in graduate study in scientific disciplines that focus on human behavior and social interaction. The course mirrors HD 2580 "Six Pretty Good Books," an introductory lecture course for entering students and students whose majors are outside the social and behavioral sciences. Both classes (2580 and 4580) will use the same set of readings, but the seminar format is a weekly 90-minute in-depth discussion rather than lecture. Most importantly, unlike 2580, 4580 is not about the books; rather, it is about how to teach the books.  Much of our in-class analysis of the books centers on identifying what are the key contributions to knowledge, as well as important limitations, and how best to communicate these ideas to students with little background in the social sciences. All students are provided the opportunity to lead one or more discussion groups in 2580.  In addition to facilitating metacognitive understanding of the books, the seminar has two additional goals: 1) to provide advanced undergraduates with an opportunity to summon, integrate, and apply insights that they have acquired over the course of their undergraduate education as they analyze arguments from the standpoint of multiple social sciences, and 2) to integrate scholarship across disciplinary lines, a major goal of University Courses.
ILRLR4860;;;US Public Sector: Shifting Power and Shrinking of Rights;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;Prerequisite: ILRLR 2010 and ILRLR 2050.;;;ILRLR6860;;;Examines the history of public employees' collective bargaining and other workplace rights. Emphasis is placed on the current trade-offs between municipal and state governments and their unionized employees in New York City and state, although trends in other states and the federal sector are also examined. Topics include representation rights, public sector workers ability to leverage their power, unfair labor practices, impasse procedures, the scope of collective bargaining, and a limited treatment of the U.S. Constitution in the public workplace. Also examines the development, practice, and extent of collective bargaining between federal, state, and local governments and their employees. Throughout, the course illustrates how the exercise of public employee rights impacts municipal, state, and federal public-policy labor-market considerations. There are several prominent guest speakers.
ILRLR4865;;;Public Education and Collective Bargaining;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;ILRLR6865;;;Using collective bargaining to push their way into the center of the middle class, school teachers and their unions have converted their economics gains into considerable political strength. As America's economic disparity widened over the last 40 years, public education successes have stalled. Many in the Middle and on the Right in America, educational reformers of all stripes, blame teachers, their unions, and collective bargaining for these "failures." Their "solutions," which we will carefully examine, include charter schools, testing of students, unilaterally created evaluations of teachers, and severe restrictions on collective bargaining. This course will address, through policy, legal, and political readings, what forms this struggle is taking in US public education and its workplaces. It will focus, in large part, on the sharpening conflict between the goals, agendas, and hopes of public school workers who now face challenges from politicians and liberal and conservative critics who see much to gain by arguing that public education success requires significant limitations of the bargaining and economic rights and power of teacher unions and their members. Graduate and undergraduate students from all colleges are encouraged to enroll. Considerable reading assignments, class room discussion, and guest lectures will characterize our work.
ILRLR4870;;;Introduction to Labor Research;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;ILRLR6870;;;Provides students interested in the labor field with the skills necessary to understand and use social science research as it relates to the labor movement. The course's four major goals are to (1) develop the skills to critically evaluate a wide variety of research relating to unions and the workplace; (2) introduce a number of quantitative and qualitative research techniques used by unions and those who study the labor movement; (3) familiarize students with the broad range of library and computer resources that can be used for labor and corporate research; and (4) provide students with an opportunity to design and conduct a research project for a national or local union.
ILRLR4880;;;Justice;;;4;;;Fall or spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;Examines major theories of justice and applies them to contemporary issues of the student's choice, such as affirmative action and reverse discrimination, income inequality, and gun control.
ILRLR5000;;;Collective Bargaining;;;3;;;Spring.;;;;;;Recommended prerequisite: previous or concurrent enrollment in ILRLR 5010.;;;;;;Comprehensive introduction to the industrial relations system of the United States. Covers the negotiation, scope, and day-to-day administration of contracts; union and employer bargaining structures; implications of industrial relations issues for U.S. competitiveness and public policy; industrial conflict; and U.S. industrial relations in international and comparative perspective.
ILRLR5010;;;Labor and Employment Law;;;3;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;Survey and analysis of the law governing labor relations and employee rights in the workplace. The first half of the course is devoted to labor law and labor-management relations. It examines the legal framework for workers' trade union organizing efforts, collective bargaining, and strikes and lockouts. The second half of the course turns to employment law outside the collective bargaining context.  It covers such topics as occupational health and safety, workers' compensation, employment discrimination, "at-will" versus "just cause" rules for dismissing employees, non-competition and mandatory arbitration agreements, and other aspects of the individual employer-employee relationship. Also serves as an introduction to judicial and administrative systems.
ILRLR6011;;;Negotiation: Theory and Practice;;;4;;;Fall or spring.;;;;;;Prerequisite: background in economics and social sciences.;;;;;;Deals with negotiation and bargaining, focusing on process, practice, and procedures. Concentrates on the use of negotiation and bargaining to resolve conflicts and disputes between organizations and groups. Discusses various theories of negotiation, including conventional "positional" bargaining, interest-based bargaining, the use of power in negotiation, and game theoretic approaches to bargaining. Examples, cases, and exercises are used to illustrate general principles. This is a generic negotiation course and thus does not deal with labor relations nor does it focus on any particular type of negotiation. Rather, it examines negotiation and bargaining generally, using examples drawn from several contexts, including employment relations, environmental disputes, real estate transactions, and other settings.
ILRLR6012;;;Managing and Resolving Conflict;;;4;;;Fall or spring.;;;;;;Prerequisite: background in economics and social sciences or permission of instructor.;;;ILRLR4012;;;Deals with managing and resolving workplace conflicts and examines dispute resolution and conflict management in both union and nonunion settings. The course covers two related topics: (1) third-party dispute resolution, including alternative dispute resolution (ADR), with a primary focus on the use of mediation and arbitration but also dealing with other dispute resolution techniques, such as fact-finding, facilitation, peer review, and the ombuds function; (2) conflict management in organizations, including the recent development of conflict management systems. The course reviews the factors that have caused the growth of ADR and conflict management systems, and it provides instruction on the design, implementation, and evaluation of such systems.
ILRLR6019;;;Dispute Resolution Practicum;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;LAW6019;;;Purpose is to link classroom discussion and analysis of arbitration and mediation with opportunities for students to observe actual arbitration and mediation cases. The course is designed to be an advanced seminar for graduate and undergraduate students who have a serious interest in pursuing a career in arbitration or mediation. Classroom discussions and readings will focus on both labor arbitration and mediation (i.e., the use of arbitration and mediation in unionized settings) and employment arbitration and mediation (i.e., the use of arbitration and mediation in cases involving nonunion employees).
ILRLR6020;;;The Practice of Labor Arbitration;;;1;;;Fall, spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;This course is designed to be an advanced seminar for graduate and undergraduate students who have a serious interest in the practice and profession of labor arbitration. Classroom discussions, group exercise and readings will focus on the role of the labor arbitrator in the public and private sectors.  During the first part of the course, topics will include the backgrounds, training, and certifications needed to establish a labor arbitration practice. In addition to focusing on how arbitrators manage hearings, the course will also cover the institutional and administrative arrangements that support the use of labor arbitration. How arbitrators are admitted to rosters and receive appointments from such "providers" as the American Arbitration Association, the Federal Mediation &amp; Conciliation Service, the New York State Public Employment Relations Board, the Cornell's ADR Services, etc.) will be examined. The rules used by Cornell and other providers will also be discussed.  The first day will conclude with a labor arbitration exercise and faculty debriefing.  During the next segments of the course, students will examine contemporary practice issues such as discovery, subpoenas, pre-hearing briefs, and problems involving availability of witnesses. Detailed coverage of the standards of contract interpretation, discipline and the role of evidence will be provided. Throughout the course, role-plays and other assignments will test students' understanding of the critical role of the arbitrator in deciding labor disputes. All case examples will be drawn from actual disputes successfully arbitrated by the course's instructor.  Course requirements include a writing assignment assessing labor arbitration as a technique for resolving workplace disputes between employers and unions. Required reading assignments will be drawn from the specialized literature on arbitration and dispute resolution.
ILRLR6022;;;Arbitration;;;4;;;Fall or spring.;;;;;;Prerequisite: ILRLR 5000 and ILRLR 5010.;;;ILRLR4022;;;Study of arbitration in the field of labor-management relations, including an analysis of principles and practices, the law of arbitration, the handling of materials in briefs and oral presentations, the conduct of mock arbitration hearing, and the preparation of arbitration opinions and post-hearing briefs.
ILRLR6023;;;Mediation: Theory and Practice;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;LAW6080;;;This course is offered to students interested in acquiring thorough knowledge of the theory and practice of mediation as well as the techniques employed by effective mediators. In the first segment of the course, students will be introduced to the guiding principles of mediation and the concept of conflict. A review of the theories of conflict, its roots and its resolution, set the stage for the role mediation can effectively play in resolving conflict. Students are introduced to the models of mediation and the benefits and challenges of each, including a comparative analysis of evaluative, facilitative and transformative styles of mediation. In the second segment, students will examine the impact of federal and state laws on the process. Significant attention will be devoted to the use of mediation in the public and federal sectors and in public sector negotiation impasses. The course will also explore the use of mediation across industries, including construction, securities, and commercial disputes.  The role of gender, race, culture, ethics and impasse in mediation will all be examined and incorporated into workshops and case studies. Through a series of workshops, students will have several opportunities to apply their knowledge of mediation and begin to develop the skills needed to become effective mediators. Students will be required to submit a final paper to complete the course requirements.
ILRLR6060;;;Theories of Industrial Relations Systems;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;Prerequisite: ILRLR 1100, ILRLR 2050, ILRLR 5000.;;;;;;Traces the evolution of theory and research on industrial relations.

ILRLR6070;;;Values, Rights, and Justice at Work;;;4;;;Fall or spring.;;;;;;;;;ILRLR4075;;;Examination of the often hidden values and assumptions that underlie the contemporary U.S. systems of employment law, work and business, and industrial relations. Classroom discussions and student research projects use short stories, plays, poems, and novels (as well as the literature of industrial and labor relations) to focus on issues such as discrimination; law, economics, and the state; work and business; power, conflict, and protest; and rights and justice.
ILRLR6073;;;Contemporary Challenges in Labor and Employment Law;;;3;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;LAW6073;;;Labor law or employment law course, or related background, strongly recommended (not required). This course will explore the challenges in enforcing the New Deal era National Labor Relations Act and other worker protection laws in a dramatically changed social and economic environment, and the evolving responses to these challenges. Highlights of the course include: changing nature of work and employment relationships (who's an employee?); the fissurization of the labor market (who's the employer); new technologies, privacy concerns and opportunities for worker activism; worker centers and community based worker organization; the New Deal collective bargaining model and today's competitive economy, labor market conditions and worker preferences; alternatives for worker representation (e.g., German style works councils); techniques and strategies to improve labor management relationships; privatized resolution of employment based disputes; local and global strategies for innovation; financialization of the economy and its impact on labor and management relationships; and the complexity of administering labor law in a politically polarized climate.
ILRLR6080;;;Special Topics in Labor Relations;;;1-4;;;Fall or spring.;;;;;;;;;ILRLR3035;;;Topics change depending on semester and instructor.
ILRLR6082;;;CB Negotiations Simulation;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;Recommended prerequisite or corequisite: collective bargaining theory and labor law course.;;;;;;Students prepare for and participate in a simulated negotiation between a hypothetical corporation and a hypothetical union in a typical big company within a midsize single site bargaining unit context. Students are assigned, usually in line with preferences, to a management or union bargaining team. The course stresses the negotiation process over settlement or substantive outcomes. Negotiation problems are as real life as possible, constrained by student time needs and with attention given to dynamic legal,political, economic, and communications concerns as well as power, information, and time factors. Participants plan for negotiations, reach agreements in principle, negotiate language, and bargain over wages, pensions, health care, and noneconomic items in the context of a company and union with an established contract, policies, and culture. This is a small, hands-on, interactive, program with active participation essential.

ILRLR6835;;;Claiming Individual Worker Rights: Promises and Challenges;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;ILRLR3835;LSP3835;LSP6835;;;This course examines the experiences of workers attempting to navigate the labor standards enforcement bureaucracy. We begin by reviewing the conditions of post-industrial labor in an era of declining unionization and weak federal and state protections. Next we review theories of legal consciousness and legal mobilization, which help explain the conditions under which low-wage workers learn about their rights and come forward to demand justice.  We walk through claimsmaking in an array of federal and state administrative bureaucracies, including wage and hour, health and safety, and discrimination.  We also look at how the immigration enforcement regime intersects with the tenets of at-will employment to grant employers wide latitude in retaliating against undocumented workers and stifling attempts at legal mobilization.  We next assess how these formal protections are filtered through various institutional gatekeepers (including legal advocates and medical experts) and how organizational compliance structures (such as human resources and mediation programs) have limited worker's ability to make claims on their rights.  We consider how intersecting bases of inequality (such as gender, race, and national origin) are processed by administrative bureaucracies, and how lay versus legal conceptions of workplace justice often diverge.  We end by considering the fallout of workplace abuse on individuals and their families.
ILRLR6860;;;US Public Sector: Shifting Power and Shrinking of Rights;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;Prerequisite: ILRLR 5000 and ILRLR 5010.;;;ILRLR4860;;;Examines the history of public employees' collective bargaining and other workplace rights.

ILROB2220;;;Controversies About Inequality;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;DSOC2220;GOVT2225;PAM2220;PHIL1950;SOC2220;;;In recent years, poverty and inequality have become increasingly common topics of public debate, as academics, journalists, and politicians attempt to come to terms with growing income inequality, with the increasing visibility of inter-country differences in wealth and income, and with the persistence of racial, ethnic, and gender stratification. This course introduces students to ongoing social scientific debates about the sources and consequences of inequality, as well as the types of public policy that might appropriately be pursued to reduce (or increase) inequality. These topics will be addressed in related unites, some of which include guest lectures by faculty from other universities (funded by the Center for the Study of Inequality). Each unit culminates with a highly spirited class discussion and debate.
ILROB2230;;;Leadership in Organizations;;;3;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;Covers basic leadership models and theories with an emphasis on how they are used in practice, analyzes leadership cases, and examines current leadership surveys and training materials. The course also covers leadership philosophies and management practices in countries outside the United States. In addition, students will learn to evaluate and use popular books on leadership and management written by leadership "gurus."
ILROB2235;;;Doing Harm: Group and Organizational Foundations;;;3;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;How it is possible that normal, everyday people can do significant harm to others (e.g. engage in humiliation, collective violence, mass killing, or "crimes against humanity"). This course uses social psychological and sociological theories to examine the group and organizational foundations for such  behaviors. Topics include intergroup hostility, authority and obedience, group and interpersonal influences, organizational structures, cultural beliefs, and the sociology of ethics.
ILROB2240;;;Social Influence and Persuasion;;;3;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;Many of the most admired organizations are adept at using social influence to achieve their strategic objectives. This course reviews basic theories of social influence such as conformity, group polarization, and social facilitation to understand how social influence tactics can be used to make organizations more efficient and productive. The course also considers how these tactics can backfire when excessive agreement gives rise to groupthink and poor decisions. Concludes by exploring strategies for managing social influence processes to encourage creativity and innovation in organizations.
ILROB2290;;;Organizational Cultures;;;3;;;Fall or spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;Reviews the concept of organizational culture. It examines the nature of ideologies as sense-making definitions of behavior, concentrating on the cultural forms that carry these cultural messages: ritual, symbols, myths, and stories. The course examines these concepts by applying them in a combination of individual papers and a team written paper.
ILROB3201;;;Organizational Change: Theory and Practice;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;Prerequisite: ILROB 1220.;;;;;;Change is fundamental to all organizations. It can be planned or unplanned, proactive or reactive, and it can involve fundamental transformation or only incremental adjustments. This course examines organizational change from both a theoretical and practical perspective. To do so, the course pairs readings drawn from Sociology and Social Psychology with case studies and in-class exercises that put you inside real organizations and give you experience making decisions in the face of ambiguous and incomplete information. We focus first on the tensions that arise when establishing and changing the design and structure of an organization. Next, we consider change in organizational culture-the assumptions, norms, and practices shared by members or a group or organization. In the final module, we examine how individuals within organizations lead and manage change.
ILROB3290;;;Organizational Cultures;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;Prerequisite: one or more courses in OB and/or sociology.;;;;;;Reviews the concept of culture as it has evolved in sociology and anthropology, applying it to formal organizations in workplaces such as corporations and unions. The course first examines the nature of ideologies as sense-making definitions of behavior, concentrating on the cultural forms that carry these cultural messages, rituals, symbols, myths, sagas, legends, and organizational stories. Considerable attention is given to rites and ceremonials as a cultural form in organizational life that consolidates many of these expressive forms into one. The course examines types of ceremonial behavior such as rites of passage, rites of enhancement, and rites of degradation, including the role of language gestures, physical settings, and artifacts in ceremonial behavior. The presence of subcultures and countercultures in organizational behavior also receive attention, especially the part played by occupational subcultures in formal organizations. College drinking is examined as an empirical example of culture and its transformation.
ILROB4203;;;The Pragmatics of Leadership: Leading Change;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;Distance Learning. This course will introduce students to the practical skills of leadership and execution as the capacity to mobilize actors, sustain and manage, negotiate and coach. Based on the principles of collective action and the idea that leadership implies not simply charisma or vision, but the strategic and tactical skills of execution. This course will put particular emphasis on political skills as essential to moving agendas ahead. Special emphasis will be placed on enhancing students' skill sets. The course combines theory, application, and exercises and will include a number of practitioners as guest lecturers. The student project will be to apply the material of the course to analysis of the actions of a particular leader. Most Monday classes will be held via distance learning and Friday classes will be face-to-face in Ithaca with the teaching assistant.
ILROB4260;;;Managing for Creativity;;;4;;;Fall or spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;Although most people can agree that creativity is an important concept, there is often very little agreement about what creativity is and how we can achieve it. This course surveys basic theories of creativity with the goal of applying this knowledge to the management of creativity in organizations. It focuses primarily on (1) cognitive theories about creative thought, (2) personality theories about exceptionally creative individuals, (3) social-psychological theories about creative groups, and (4) the points at which these approaches interact. The course concludes by questioning whether, given the costs involved, anyone would willingly follow the path of a creative individual or implement the practices of the most innovative firms.
ILROB4710;;;Social Science Research Methods;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;Prerequisite: ILRST 2100 or comparable statistics.;;;;;;The goal of this course is to give students the foundational skills necessary to conduct scientific research in the field of organizational behavior. Topics covered will include generating research ideas, ethical considerations, common experimental and non-experimental designs, creating surveys and other measures, interpreting results, and writing research papers. Students will be asked to conduct their own research projects as part of the class. This course focuses on methods from psychology and related disciplines and is recommended for students considering doing honors thesis research.
ILROB4750;;;Women in Management and Entrepreneurship;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;ILROB6750;;;The purpose of this course is three-fold: 1) to examine literature on women in management, leadership and entrepreneurship 2) to develop the ability to use different feminist perspectives to evaluate research on gender in organizations and 3) to apply both traditional research on gender and feminist perspectives to problems facing organizations. We will first review the literature on women in management, leadership, and entrepreneurship. We will then cover a blend of classic and contemporary feminist perspectives on organizations to understand the evolution of feminist thought in the field of OB and to analyze how both traditional and feminist approaches can inform research and practice.  The major goals of this course are to provide students with 1) an overview of gender research in the field of organizational behavior 2) to increase their understanding of how different feminist perspectives can inform research and practice 3) to support them in generating new questions, models and/or frameworks that can be used by organizations.

General topics include distributive bargaining, integrative negotiations, psychological biases, sources of power, and multiparty negotiations. Advanced topics include dispute resolution, emotionally intelligent negotiations, and team on team negotiations (e.g., union-management, mergers). Simulations, exercises, role playing, and cases are emphasized.  If you have completed ILRLR 6011 you are NOT eligible to take this course.
ILROB6710;;;Work, Health, and Health Care;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;The health care industry is the fastest growing segment of the U.S. economy. This course examines the interplay between business organizations, which fund employee health insurance, and health. The first half focuses on U.S. organizations with topics ranging from corporate culture and power to the structure of work in health care organizations. For instance, the class will examine how power and corporate culture influence the definition of health, employee attention to safety, and employee willingness to use wellness programs.

Throughout the life cycle of any research effort decisions are made in design and data analysis which raise ethical problems.  Through an examination of each stage of research and analysis the thorny real problems are raised. Each problem is then linked to issues of accountability, analysis implications, and ultimate conclusions. Professional guidelines are used to develop the situations as well as the process of decision-making. Through applied situations students will gain an appreciation for the role of the analyst, the existence of professional guidelines and protections, and the need for open disclosure of decisions.

INFO6561;;;Technologies of Valuation;;;4;;;Spring. (Offered once every 1-2 years);;;;;;;;;STS6561;;;Valuation is a pervasive feature of contemporary life. Professors, universities, hotels, markets, movies, user experience, intelligence - almost everything is subject to some form of review, rating, or ranking these days. This course examines valuation as a key techno-scientific practice and asks how value is established, maintained, compared, subverted, resisted, and institutionalized in a range of different settings. Through a mix of reading, writing, and practical exercises, we shall engage with theoretical, historical, and ethnographic studies of (e)valuation in science &amp; technology studies, but also draw on related areas like economic sociology, the sociology of evaluation, accounting studies, anthropology, and information science.
INFO6710;;;Revolutions of the Mind: Media, Technology and Epistemological Change;;;3;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;COMM6710;;;Revolution: a change in organizational structure or power balance; turn-around; modification of an existing constitution. Current technologies and media are revolutionizing the way we think, what we know, and what we do. This course examines what it means to "think about knowledge differently" and "change your mind" by looking at the dynamic interaction between how people and society transform and are transformed by various forms of information and new media technologies. Examples from education (e.g., MOOCs), entertainment, virtual reality, and connective media contextualize this investigation into epistemological development, thought and action, and ethics of change.

ITAL2203;;;Languages/Literatures/Identities;;;3;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;Prerequisite: ITAL 2201 or equivalent.;;;;;;This course, which is conducted in Italian and includes significant practice in grammar, vocabulary building, and composition, aims to foster reflection about the relationship among languages, literatures, and identities in Italy. Topic for fall 2014: "Living together in a multicultural society." Our principal reading will be Scontro di civilta per un ascensore a piazza Vittorio, a 2006 award-winning novel by the Algerian-Italian writer Amara Lakhous who came to Italy in 1995 as a political refugee; with this novel, he invites Italian readers to examine their 21st-century reality through the eyes of the immigrant.
ITAL2900;;;Perspectives in Italian Culture;;;3;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;;;;This survey of modern Italian culture aims to acquaint students with the most important social, political and artistic developments occurring in Italian culture today. These include the effects of geographic and national fragmentation on political life in post-Risorgimento Italy; the "Southern Question" as it is known in Italy, especially the relation between southern regions like Sicily and Calabria and the North;  the phenomenon of "Cosa Nostra"; Italian contributions to world cinema in classics like "Rome Open City", "The Bicycle Thief", and more recently "Gomorrah"; Italian cooking and its relation to national identity; and Italy as a multi-ethnic territory. By providing students with a variety of cultural, political, and anthropological perspectives on Italian culture, students will get to see (and eat) for themselves how Italian culture is produced and consumed globally today.  Readings include selections from the works of Leonardo Sciascia and Carlo Levi and from film directors Roberto Rossellini, Vittorio de Sica, Sergio Leone, and Roberto Benigni.  A group of secondary readings will be used to complement our discussion of the current trends and issues facing contemporary Italy.
ITAL2950;;;The Cinematic Eye of Italy;;;3;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;Prerequisite: ITAL 2201 or permission of instructor.;;;;;;This course, which is at the core of the major and minor in Italian, is designed to give students a basic grounding in some of the most important facets of Italian culture, including cinema, literature, art, and food.  Students will trace the development of Italian national identity in literary and cinematic texts as well as across Italian photography and cuisine.  Readings will include selections from the works of Primo Levi, Roberto Saviano, and Leonardo Sciascia.  Students will also view films by directors such as Rossellini, de Sica, Antonioni, Bertolucci, and Sergio Leone, becoming familiar along the way with genres in Italian national cinema.  By the end of the semester, students will have a working knowledge of the effects of geographic and national fragmentation on political life in post-Risorgimento Italy, understand the so-called Southern Question and the fraught relationship between the Italian South and wealthier Northern regions, and gain difference perspectives on political life today in Italy.
ITAL3240;;;One Italian Masterpiece;;;2;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;This 2-credit course will introduce students to sustained study of one Italian masterpiece (a literary, philosophical, historical, or scientific work, or a major achievement in the visual, performance, or media arts).

ITAL3300;;;Save the Story! Alessandro Manzoni's I promessi sposi;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;Prerequisite: ITAL 2202 or permission of instructor.;;;;;;In Italy's most famous novel, I promessi sposi (1840), Alessandro Manzoni offers us an unforgettable story of young lovers (Renzo and Lucia) whose plans to marry are disrupted by a powerful lord (Don Rodrigo) who wants the young woman for himself.  Evil has plenty of helpers (thugs and bullies, a spineless clergyman, an incompetent and worthless lawyer, a nun of questionable morals, and an unscrupulous robber baron), but there are also those who come to the young lovers' aid (including the robber baron called "l'nnominato" or "He-Who-Remains-Nameless," who experiences a miraculous conversion just in time).  Evil gets its due and Love wins out.  The story of I promessi sposi  is crucial for the way that Italians understand their national character and the social and ethical dilemmas that they face.  It is a tale that Italians love to retell and to parody.  Read the novel this semester, try your hand at writing about it (including creatively!) and discover why Italians like Umberto Eco say that this story is worth saving.
ITAL3490;;;Literature and Moral Complexity;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;COML3531;FREN3490;ROMS3490;;;In this course, we will ask how literature helps us to formulate ethical questions, i.e., question for which there is no single, objectively correct answer.  Why literature as opposed to philosophy or history?  Numerous aspects of literture make it ideal for taking on complex ethical questions.  Literture can be used to persuade or even manipulate; it appeals to our emotions as well as our reason, and may even call into question the neat division between the two; it forges sympathies that tie us as readers to characters and narrators, even as we suspect their motives.  For most of our time together, we will focus on great writers and storytellers of early modern Europe (e.g., Boccaccio, Machiavelli, Montaigne, Marguerite de Navarre, Bandello), but we will also explore how ethical questions posed by these early modern writers continue to surface in the work of an author like Barbey D'Aurevilly and in a contemporary movie such as Stephen Spielberg's Lincoln. If there is student interest, we will offer discussion sections in French and Italian.
ITAL3510;;;Machiavelli;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;HIST3510;MEDVL3510;;;This course presents Machiavelli in a variety of historical and interpretive contexts; European and Italian politics in the early sixteenth century; the decline of the Florentine republic and the rise of the Medicean principate; Machiavelli's career in government and his, and the republic's, crisis in 1512-13; the intellectual traditions of Renaissance humanism, political thought, and the revival of antiquity; vernacular literary currents and popular culture; and the political writers and theorists with whom Machiavelli associated and corresponded. Emphasis is placed on a close reading of the major works (including the letters, The Prince, the Discourses, Mandragola, and selections from The Art of War and the Florentine Histories, all in translation) and a critical examination, in the light of that reading, of some major modern interpretations of Machiavelli.

JPLIT4400;;;Modern Japanese Literature: The State of the Field;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;JPLIT6600;;;This survey course covers major works of Japanese prose fiction from the late 19th century to the present, while also considering how understandings of the "literary" itself have shifted during this period. Newer studies of media theory, the history of the book, and the "city as text" in Meiji Japan have blurred the boundaries between texts considered "high" (Shimazaki Toson's depiction of social discrimination in The Broken Commandment) and "popular," such as  best-selling melodramas Namiko and The Golden Demon, whose appearance accompanied the rise of Japan as an imperial power. While reader's interests in the late 20th century have shifted away from the introspective psychological novel towards detective fiction, manga narrative, and even the cell-phone novel, it is also true that previously marginalized groups such as women, zainichi, and Okinawan writers have emerged at the forefront of this literary production as an energizing force. What is at stake in telling the "story" of modern Japanese literature? All texts will be read in English translation.

Rather than thinking of Judaism as static and easily definable, we will explore a history that is complex and dynamic. Over the three thousand year period that we will be studying, individuals and groups who identified themselves as Israelites or Jews developed a remarkable variety of beliefs and practices in conversation and in competition with other groups, including Christianity and Islam. We will examine trends and key moments of this process in order to understand how continuity and change, the construction of identity, and the competition for legitimacy have shaped our contemporary ideas about what Judaism is. We will approach this subject from a historical perspective, analyzing material evidence and reading texts from each period in translation, and from a religious studies perspective, carefully observing how the meaning of categories such as religion and Judaism change over time. A better understanding of these changes can help us better to appreciate difference and conflict both ancient and contemporary.
JWST2668;;;Ancient Egyptian Civilization;;;3;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;ARKEO2668;NES2668;;;The course surveys the history and culture of pharaonic Egypt from its prehistoric origins down to the early first millennium bce. Within a chronological framework, the following themes or topics will be considered: the development of the Egyptian state (monarchy, administration, ideology), social organization (class, gender and family, slavery), economic factors, and empire and international relations.
JWST2674;;;History of the Modern Middle East: Nineteenth to Twentieth Centuries;;;3;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;ASRC2674;GOVT2747;HIST2674;NES2674;;;This course examines major trends in the evolution of the Middle East in the modern era. Focusing on the 19th and 20th centuries and ending with the  "Arab Spring," we will consider Middle East history with an emphasis on five themes: imperialism, nationalism, modernization, Islam, and revolution.  Readings will be supplemented with translated primary sources, which will form the backbone of class discussions.
JWST2687;;;Environmental Issues in the Contemporary Middle East;;;3;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;BSOC2681;GOVT2583;NES2687;;;Centrally located between two continents; the Middle East is drawn by nature to many environmental challenges that are re-lated to its unequal distribution of natural resources associated with its geological setting, mosaic ethnic composition, and cultural diversity. Such environmental background sets the need for an essential understanding of challenges that faces the area and is likely fundamental to its survival. In this course, we will assess environmental issues facing the current Middle East including but not limited to i. population exponential growth, ii. water scarcity, iii. natural resources distribution, iv. en-vironmental hazards associated with conflict, and v. tourism to provide future recommendations for environmental man-agement that focuses mainly on youth involvement i.e. the concerned generation.
JWST2695;;;Introduction to Christian History;;;3;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;CLASS2636;NES2695;RELST2695;;;This course offers an introduction to the history of Christianity from the first century through the seventeenth and perhaps a bit beyond. Our emphasis will be on the diversity of Christian traditions, beliefs, and practices throughout history. We will explore the origins of Christianity within the eastern Mediterranean world, the spread of Christianity, the development of ecclesiastical institutions, the rise and establishment of monasticism, and the various controversies that occupied the church throughout its history. Throughout the course, we will supplement our reading of primary texts with art, archaeology, music, and manuscripts.
JWST2711;;;Politics of Violence in Twentieth Century Europe;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;GOVT2716;HIST2711;;;This course provides a survey of Europe's 20th-century history with special emphasis on violence and its interpretation. Types of violence to be considered include warfare, terrorism, genocide, uprisings, and assassination, among others. Discussions of the First and Second World Wars and the political and ethnic clashes of the Cold War and decolonization will be supplemented by less familiar instances of violence in the European context. Lectures, readings and written assignments will focus on deciphering the various political motivations behind calls for and interpretations of violence.
JWST2724;;;Introduction to the Hebrew Bible;;;3;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;NES2724;RELST2724;;;The Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) is a repository of ancient Israelite religious, political, social, historical, and literary traditions. For the modern reader these ancient traditions are often obscured by a focus on the text as revelation. The purpose of this course is to introduce students to the biblical world by reading the Hebrew Bible in translation, on its own terms, as a body of literature that evolved in an ancient Near Eastern context. The Bible itself will be the primary text for the course, but students will also be exposed to the rich and diverse textual traditions of the ancient Near East, including Mesopotamia, Egypt, Moab, and Ugarit. In addition, this course will explore the impact of early biblical interpretation on shaping the monotheistic traditions inherited in the West. As participants in a secular course on the Bible, students will be challenged to question certain cultural assumptions about the composition and authorship of the Bible, and will be expected to differentiate between a text's content and its presumed meaning.
JWST2777;;;Introduction to Rabbinic Literature and History;;;3;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;CLASS2631;NES2777;RELST2777;;;This course offers an overview of Rabbinic Literature from the first century BCE through the eight century of the Common Era. Each class will combine broad historical background with the close reading of Rabbinic texts. We will not only try to understand what these texts say and how they say it but we will also explore how Rabbinic ideas and modes of expression compare to those with which we as modern readers are more familiar. We will begin with a survey of various forms of Bibli-cal and post-Biblical Second Temple writings. These texts will serve to establish the literary frameworks against which the rabbinic genres form. We will then explore the Mishanh, the Tosefta, and the Palestinian and Babylonian Talmuds. Through an exploration of the development of parallel themes, we will come to an understanding of how and when these texts evolved. Finally, we will explore a number of Midrashic compilations and assess their historical settings as well as their literary and ideological relationships to the two Talmuds. All Texts will be read in translation.

JWST3637;;;History and Literature of Early Christianity;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;CLASS3637;MEDVL3637;NES3637;NES6637;RELST3637;;;This course traces the historical development of Christianity from its roots in 1st century Palestinian Judaism to the emergence of Islam in the early 7th century, with special emphasis on the period prior to the "conversion" of Constantine in the 4rth century. The focus will be on exploring the rich diversity of Christianity in late antiquity by reading a wide range of primary literary sources, including selections from the New Testament, church fathers, apocryphal writings, gnostic literatures, saints lives, and much more. In addition, we will study the material culture of early Christianity through archaeology, art, inscriptions, and papyri. Special attention will be given to the varieties of Christianity and the ways in which various forms of Christianity in different regions around the Mediterranean interfaced with paganism, Judaism, and Islam.
JWST3655;;;Minorities of the Middle East;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;NES3655;;;In the media we read about conflict in Iraq between Sunnis, Shiites, and Kurds; strife between Muslims and Copts in Egypt; rebellion in Syria against the ruling Alawite minority; and violence between Israelis and Palestinians; and the list goes on. This course aims to enrich students' understanding of the diversity of Middle Eastern countries, exploring histories of inter-communal contact and conflict. In commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of World War I, we will begin our exploration by reflecting on the legacy of the Ottoman Empire and the impact of its dissolution. We will focus our attention on commercial centers that fostered inter-communal relations, as well as investigating sites of strife and cases of minority repression. We will read histories, memoirs, and fiction, and view films that help us better understand inter-communal relations, tensions, and conflict. We will also interrogate the terms for exploring a range distinctions among majority and minority populations including: religious difference (Muslims, Christians, and Jews); divisions of religious rite (Sunni and Shiite); entho-linguistic minorities (Armenians and Kurds); national identities (Israelis and Palestinians); cultures of origin (Mizrahi, Sephardi, and Ashkenazi Jews).

Each week will feature grammar lessons and a reading of an important Sumerian historical or literary work in English translation. Through lecture and discussion, the class will explore the deep roots of the Sumerian historical memory, the origins of Mesopotamian civilization, and the role of the central government in the development of writing.
JWST3700;;;History of the Holocaust;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;HIST3700;;;This course will analyze the meaning of the Holocaust from three vantage points: that of European history; that of Jewish history; and that of those states and religious institutions that shared responsibility by having stood by in silence.  Topics include:  the  evolution of modern anti-Semitism, the role of anti-Semitism in the Nazi ideology and program; the bureaucratization of death; Jewish life in ghettos and concentration  camps; the fate of Jews in occupied Europe and the question collaboration; Jewish political behavior under duress; the responses of the Western allies and the Churches; contemporary interpretations of the Holocaust and the meaning of evil.
JWST3740;;;Medieval Travel and Exploration;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;COML3724;MEDVL3740;NES3740;;;In the Middle Ages, people traveled for all many reasons: for adventure, for commerce, on pilgrimage, for conquest.  We will read the accounts of medieval travelers in order better to understand the motives and motivations for travel and for exploration.  Our travelers will include Christian, Jewish, and Muslim merchants, ambassadors, scholars, geographers, explorers, sailors and soldiers.  Readings will include Margery Kempe, Marco Polo, Ibn Battutah, Usama ibn Munqidh, and Benjamin of Tudela.  All material in English translation.

JWST4180;;;The Imaginary Jew: Roots of Antisemitism in Medieval England;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ENGL4180;ENGL6180;JWST6180;MEDVL4180;MEDVL6180;;;When did anti-Semitism begin? The medieval period invented shocking fictions about Jews--that they killed and ate Christian babies; that they desecrated the Host; that they were the murderers of Christ. In manuscripts Jews were visually compared to beasts, devils, and perverts. By law, Jews were forced to live in ghettos, wear distinctive dress, abstain from certain professions, and suffer exile. Beginning with Shakespeare's Shylock, we will work our way back through visual and literary treatments of Jews in the Middle Ages, reading texts by Chaucer, chronicles, miracle stories, crusader romances, and mystery plays. Drawing on recent theories of the other we will also consider how medieval representations of Jews and other minorities were used to construct medieval communal, religious, and political identities.
JWST4230;;;Perspectives in Intellectual History: Modernity, Cataclysm and the Jews (1880-1930);;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;GERST4231;GERST6231;HIST4232;HIST6232;JWST6230;ROMS4230;ROMS6230;;;Between the end of the nineteenth century and the second World War, the Jewish intellectual appears as a new figure of European societies, quickly becoming a major actor in public spheres.  During those years, the Jewish intellectual becomes a privileged object of investigations, definitions and fantasies -- including anti-Semitic stereotypes -- for literature and popular culture, sociology and medicine or law, deeply shaping national mentalities and imagination.  A considerable iconography, from painting to political propaganda and illustrated magazines, sketches his real or invented profile.  As an incarnation of urbanity, mobility, extraterritoriality, textuality and rational thought, the Jewish intellectual turns out to be a mirror of modernity, eliciting a strong conservative rejection.  Lasting from the Dreyfus Affair to the Nazi burning of books in 1933, and focusing on three national contexts -- France, Germany and Italy -- the course tries to explore the history of this collective representation through its multiple expressions, both textual and visual.

It is during those years, nevertheless, that the destruction of European Jews aroused an intellectual debate whose philosophical, political, and literary contributions constitute landmarks for contemporary culture and criticism.  The course will explore the reasons for such a discrepancy, reconstructing the steps of the integration of the Holocaust into our historical consciousness.  It will analyze some of the most significant attempts to think such a trauma made by German-Jewish exiles (Arendt, Adorno, Anders), the survivors of the Nazi camps (Amery, Levi, Celan, Antelme), as well as the public intellectuals on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean (Sartre, Bataille, MacDonald, etc).
JWST4525;;;Palestinians in Israel;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;Prerequisite:  Reading skills in Arabic and Hebrew.;;;NES4525;;;Following the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948 and the first Arab-Israeli war, over 150,000 Palestinian Arabs remained in Israel. Referred to by the Arab media as "1948 Arabs" or "Arabs within" and by the Israeli media as "Israeli Arabs" or "the Arab sector," this community is often overlooked in discussions about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the peace process. In this seminar we will focus our attention on the history, experiences, and identity of this marginalized, and largely bilingual community. We will read and discuss a range of texts in Hebrew and Arabic by and about Palestinian-Israelis. Readings will include historical and sociological studies, journalism, and literature. Students are expected to have achieved an advanced level of either Hebrew or Arabic and an intermediate level of the other language.
JWST4557;;;Desert Monasticism;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;CLASS4677;MEDVL4557;NES4557;RELST4557;;;How and why do landscapes come to inspire the religious imagination? And how do sensory landscapes, more specifically-territories of sight, sound, touch, taste, and smell-inform, inflect, and engage the religious imagination? When and why do religious practices, rituals, traditions, and beliefs inhabit particular landscapes? This seminar treats these questions by focusing on a particular landscape-the "desert," both imagined and real-as it has shaped religious ascetic practice. Biblical notions of howling desert wastelands and subsequent ideas about deserts inhabited by terrifying and grotesque demons; paradise, a garden where angels' wings whir and pure light shines; valleys of rattling dry bones, sinews, and skins that breathe with new life; heavens clanging with the sound of war between seven-headed dragons and angels; demons coming in the forms of roaring lions and hissing serpents-the religious imaginary is shaped in striking ways by sensory landscapes. We will read widely from desert Christian monastic literatures, mostly from late ancient Egypt, to explore both the historical development of monasticism in Christianity and examine why the monastic impulse seems so closely tied to the "desert." In addition to reading saints lives, we will read early monastic rules, the desert fathers, and we will draw from archaeological sources to examine the varieties of ascetic practices in the deserts of late ancient Egypt, Gaza, Sinai, Palestine, and Syria. Throughout the course we will explore ancient and modern ideas about "wilderness" and we will explore parallels between ancient Near Eastern literatures and their nineteenth- and twentieth-century parallels in the American frontier and environmental literatures.
JWST4628;;;Gnosticism and Early Christianity;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;CLASS4636;NES4628;RELST4628;;;What is "Gnosticism" and why has it come to be so hotly debated among scholars and in our contemporary media? What is the Gospel of Judas and are its ideas "heretical"? Who wrote the Gospel of Thomas and the Gospel of Mary and why were these Gospels not included in the New Testament canon? To what extent did Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code draw from ancient Christian gnostic sources? This seminar will explore answers to these questions and many others by focusing on the complex array of literary sources from late antiquity-primarily from a cache of manuscripts found at Nag Hammadi, Egypt, in 1945-that have long been associated with a so-called "Christian Gnosticism." Church Fathers condemned the "movement" on a variety of grounds, but in this course we will not simply read the condemnations written by the opponents of gnostic thought; rather, we will focus our attention on reading (in English translation) substantial portions of the "gnostic" texts written by the adherents themselves. We will give special attention to the ways in which conflicts about Gnosticism connected with conflicts about gender, heresy, power, and authority. To set these texts within a socio-historical context, we will discuss the possible Jewish and hellenistic roots of early Christian Gnosticism and ties to Stoic and other ancient philosophical movements.
JWST4670;;;Wealth and Power: Political Economy in Ancient Near Eastern States;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;ARKEO4670;NES4670;;;Early states emerged when select groups gained control over wealth and power and institutionalized that control. How this was accomplished is a question of political economy that we can approach from archaeological, anthropological, and sociological perspectives. The course introduces students to the intellectual development of historical materialism in Smith, Marx, and Weber, among others, and traces their influence on later socioeconomic historians such as Polanyi and Finley. More recent approaches deriving from world-systems, gender studies, post-colonial studies, game theory, and network theory are then applied to case studies that include the emergence of a Mesopotamian state ca. 3400 BC, the Akkadian and Ur III empires, Old Babylonian and Old Assyrian trade, pharaonic Egypt, the international Late Bronze Age world, Aegean palatial civilization, and the Phoenicians. Students are welcome to present and write on other topics also. Monroe will provide context and clarification to assist with the specialist literature, but prior coursework in ancient studies will be advantageous in critically evaluating and writing about all the course readings.
JWST4776;;;Talmud and the Art of Reading;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;CLASS4637;NES4776;RELST4776;;;The Babylonian Talmud has long been viewed as the central text of post-Biblical Judaism.  Yet little is known about who wrote it and when it was written.  Since the Talmud is an extremely difficult text to master, its readership has therefore until recently been limited to few expert traditional scholars.  Over the past fifty or so years, with the advent of translations and study guides, the Talmud has gained increasing popularity. The Talmud has long been viewed as a source for history, law, or moral lessons. But literature interacts with the cultures that produce and read it in far more nuanced and significant ways. In the past century, advances in theories of how and why to read literature have opened up new avenues for understanding what the Talmud says and, more importantly, how it works . This course will examine provocative, bizarre, and salacious Talmud passages through the lens of the evolution of the major theoretical schools of the past century. Each week we will explore a theoretical movement ( e.g. New Criticism, Formalism, Post-Stucturalism, Feminist Criticism, New Historicism , etc .) and apply their reading strategies to close readings of Talmud passages.  We will simultaneously read the work of modern Talmud scholars whose reading practices align with each of these theoretical schools.  All Texts will be read in translation and no previous knowledge of Talmud or Critical Theory is necessary.
JWST4910;;;East European Jewish Culture;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ANTHR4810;ANTHR7810;JWST7910;NES4910;NES7910;;;An autonomous, diasporic Jewish culture flourished in Eastern Europe from the early modern period through the mid-twentieth century and beyond. It is the ancestral culture of the vast majority of American Jews today, and thus a major source of American culture more generally. Its productions span the range of the religious and the secular, and trouble those very categories. Its reford constitutes a treasure trove of reflections on universality and particularity, self-determination and domination, the search for individual expression and the call of collective solidarity. This course will draw on a wide range of disciplines (especially anthropology, history, and literary studies) and a wide range of genres (fiction, historiography, autobiography, film) to recapture some sense of the living, dynamic cultural world of East European Jews.

He is seen as a bridging figure between German and Jewish studies, between materialist critique of culture and the submerged yet powerful voice of theology, between literary history and philosophy. We will review Benjamin's life and some of the key disputes over his heritage; read some of the best-known of his essays; and devote significant time to his enigmatic and enormously rich masterwork, the Arcades Project, concluding with consideration of the relevance of Benjamin's insights for cultural and political dilemmas today.

LATA1950;;;The Invention of the Americas;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;HIST1950;;;When did the 'Americas' come in to being?  Who created 'them' and how? What other geographic units of analysis might we consider in thinking about what Iberian explorers and intellectuals initially called the 'fourth part' of the world?  Given the scope and extent of the Spanish and Portuguese empires, could 'the Americas' extend from the Caribbean to the Philippines?  This course takes up such questions as a means to explore the history of what would become-only in the nineteenth century-'Latin America.' We move from the initial "encounters" of peoples from Africa and Iberia with the "New World," the creation of long-distance trade with, and settlement in, Asia, and the establishment of colonial societies, through to the movements for independence in most of mainland Spanish America in the early 19th century and to the collapse of Spanish rule in the Pacific and Caribbean later that century.

LATA3031;;;Race and Revolution in the Americas: 1776-1900;;;4;;;;;;;;;;;;AMST3032;ASRC3031;HIST3031;;;This course will examine the "age of democratic revolutions" in the Americas from the perspective of the Black Atlantic. During this momentous era, when European monarchies were successfully challenged and constitutional governments created, Blacks fomented their own American revolutions both in the outside of evolving "New World democracies." This course examines the black trajectory in British North America, Latin America, the French (especially Haiti,) the British and the Spanish Caribbean. The course begins with black participation in the U.S. independence War (1776-1781) and concludes with black (non-U.S.) participation in the independence wars against Spain. The course will also briefly address post-emancipation race relations in these American countries.
LATA3065;;;Immigrant America: Race and Citizenship in Modern Working-Class History;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;AMST3065;ILRLR3065;LSP3065;;;Immigration discourse and policy has played a central role in shaping the modern American nation-state, including its composition, values, and institutions. This course begins in the late nineteenth century, defining it as a pivotal moment in U.S. immigration and labor history when efforts to regulate immigrant entry and naturalization became increasingly bureaucratized. As part of the course we will examine the causes and consequences of working-class migration to the United States from a comparative historical, ethno-racial, class-based, and gendered perspective. We will also address questions regarding the perceived benefit and cost of immigration at both the national and local (i.e., community) levels. In this sense, we will explore the economic, social, cultural, and political impact immigrants have had on the United States over time. Finally, we will consider how immigrants have negotiated the pressures of their new surroundings, and challenged dominant conceptions of American national identity and citizenship in the process.
LATA3290;;;Comparative Politics of Latin America;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;DSOC3290;GOVT3293;;;This course is designed as an introduction to political, economic, and social issues in 20th-century Latin America.

LATA4161;;;Visual Cultures of the Andes;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ARTH4161;ARTH6161;LATA6161;VISST4161;;;This seminar focuses on visual and performative cultures of the Andes from the Inca empire (ca. 1438-1534) to the present day. It traces the modalities of culture, power, and representation in the framing of Andean pasts and presents by tracing the social lives of images in Andean South America, which encompasses parts of Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, and Argentina. We will analyze a range of visual material, including textiles, paintings, photographs, and even tourist brochures to understand the dynamics of image-making and image consumption in the Andes. Given the seminar's broad temporal scope, we will embark on a series of case studies that serve to contextualize each historical moment of artistic production, from the Inca and colonial periods to the postcolonial period spanning the 19th century to the present. The final section of the course focuses on the politics of marketing "Andeanness" to contemporary audiences through museum displays, folkloric performances, and tourism.

LATA4369;;;Performing Latinidades;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;COML4369;COML6349;LSP4369;LSP6349;;;This seminar focuses on Latino/a performance within a variety of genres, including drama, film, music, and performance art. The "new global condition" between US Latino/as and Latin America guides our inquiry into local, national and transnational cultural practices. We begin by looking at theoretical work by scholars like Augusto Boal, Bertolt Brecht, and Diana Taylor that help us to better understand the political and social dimensions of performance. Using these frameworks as a point of departure, we examine a range of particular issues that connect diasporic Latino communities around specific cultural practices, including the politics of claiming space, the making of a Latina/o public sphere, transnational and multilingual imaginaries, cultural production and consumption, and alternative/subversive performance practices.  Texts may include works by authors like Carmelita Tropicana, Guillermo Gomez-Pena, Victor Hugo Rascon Banda, Nilo Cruz, Miguel Pinero, and Cristina Michaus.
LATA4732;;;The New Latin American State;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ANTHR4732;ANTHR7732;LATA7732;;;Latin America today is the site of multiple utopian and practical experiments in governance. This seminar will problematize the simultaneous growth of neo-liberal, neo-socialist, and para-state formations. Using ethnography, documentary film, and theories of Latin American geopolitics, we will explore how dominant paradigms for political economy and fantasies of control emerge within contests over charisma, power, and legitimate violence. Why have indigenous and ethno-racialized social movements, or the return of the traditionally repressed, figured in projects of national or counter-national revitalization? What roles have self-defense organizations played in the re-definition of civil society? What does it mean to advocate for 'cultural diversity' or 'rights of nature'? Why have discourses of 'security' and 'human rights' come to be so charged in state bureaucracies and horizontalist political associations alike? This seminar will delve into a wide ranging array of texts that probe these and other questions about the new Latin American state.

LAW6113;;;Arbitration Law, Policy, and Practice;;;3;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;This course is designed to familiarize students with the law, policy, and practice of arbitration. Arbitration is the principal method of resolving disputes between unions and employers, securities brokers and their customers, and under international business agreements, and it has gained favor in many other areas, including consumer, employment, construction, and insurance disputes. This course will explore the doctrines governing arbitration, including arbitrability, arbitral due process, and judicial review of arbitration awards. The course will also explore the vigorous public policy debates that have developed around arbitration, particularly its use in consumer and employment contracts.

Legal topics to be covered include business formation and capitalization, fiduciary obligations, shareholder voting, derivative suits, corporate control transactions, and the purpose of the film. We shall also devote some attention to closely held corporations and other business forms.
LAW6158;;;Client Counseling;;;1;;;Spring. (Meets only part of semester);;;;;;;;;;;;Clients come to lawyers seeking problem-solving advice.

LAW6241;;;Federal White Collar Crime;;;3;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;This course examines some of the principal statutes used to prosecute corporate and white collar crime. Theories of liability we will consider include traditional white collar offenses like mail and wire fraud, insider trading, false statements, perjury, and obstruction of justice. They also include more recent entries into the field such as RICO, money laundering, and laws enacted to combat government contract fraud. In addition the course provides an introductory look at the workings of the now-advisory Federal Sentencing Guidelines.
LAW6242;;;Corporate Finance;;;3;;;Fall, spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;Any practice of business law requires a knowledge of accounting and corporate finance to be able to properly advise one's clients.

LAW6264;;;Criminal Procedures: Investigations;;;3;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;Criminal Procedure: Investigations examines the constitutional law that governs police attempts to solve crime and bring perpetrators to justice. The course considers the role of the Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures as well as the Fifth Amendment ban on compelled self-incrimination, in guiding police behavior and in structuring the trials that follow constitutional violations. Students will evaluate the wisdom and constitutional validity of the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule, which prohibits the introduction of evidence obtained as a result of an unreasonable search, and the well-known Miranda v. Arizona decision as it has evolved over time.
LAW6298;;;Private Equity Playbook;;;3;;;Fall.;;;;;;Prerequisite: Business Organizations.;;;NBA6970;;;This course will examine the private equity industry by exploring the many roles that lawyers can play in advising private equity firms and their investors. It will highlight the ways in which lawyers can best advise private equity clients by understanding their client's business objectives and by developing the judgment necessary to be effective counselors. The course will focus on private equity acquisitions (including public and private transactions), as well as on the evolving fundraising market and the investor community, financing private equity transactions, exit transactions (such as IPOs, strategic and secondary sales), governance issues in private equity portfolio companies, regulatory and litigation issues facing private equity firms, the role of management in private equity transactions, and the issues that arise when private equity portfolio companies become troubled.

LAW6335;;;Emerging Growth Companies and Venture Capital Financing: Principles and Practice;;;3;;;Fall.;;;;;;Prerequisite: Business Organizations.;;;NBA6960;;;The start-up high technology enterprise, privately financed largely with funds provided by angel investors and venture capital firms, is a successful source of important new and technologically innovative products.  Many highly visible and successful companies have raised venture capital at some point in their life cycle.  This course covers the legal and business issues that arise in the context of representing emerging growth companies and the venture capital investors who provide an important source of capital to such companies. In particular, the course will focus on the legal issues typically encountered by private companies at formation, financing, operation and key corporate events, including acquisition transactions and public offerings. Topics covered will include corporate formation and governance, angel investments (both equity and debt), venture capital financing, employment and equity compensation matters, protection of intellectual property, securities laws compliance, venture debt financing and exit strategies through merger, acquisition or initial public offering. The course will offer an introduction to these topics through the eyes of attorneys who practice in a leading Silicon Valley-based law firm active in New York City's technology market and may also include guest presentations by industry participants, such as venture capitalists, angel investors and entrepreneurs.
LAW6361;;;Environmental Law;;;3;;;Spring.;;;;;;Recommended prerequisite: Taking administrative law, either before or contemporaneous with environmental law, is strongly advised, but not required.;;;;;;The course surveys the major environmental laws, with a primary focus on federal statutes. Emphasis will be placed on the various sources of liability to both individuals and corporations from common law, statutory provisions, administrative regulation and enforcement policy.

Other topics considered include: the legal significance of marriage rights and obligations; non-marital relationships and their regulation; and domestic violence.
LAW6422;;;Family Law Clinic;;;2;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;Students will assist indigent clients in obtaining uncontested divorces and initial support orders. Skills learned include client interviewing and drafting pleadings, judgments, and other state-mandated forms.
LAW6430;;;Financial Markets and Institutions;;;3;;;;;;;;;;;;NBA5430;NBA5430;;;This course presents an overview of the structure and function of the financial markets. The course attempts to provide a general working knowledge of the financial system by examining not only how various intermediaries and markets work, but also their evolution over time.  The role of central banks, and their operations, is particularly emphasized, as is the nature of risk management both within the financial institution and more broadly for the financial system. Topics considered here include swaps, credit derivatives, value at risk models, and systemic risk. Just as intermediation has moved from institutions to markets, the course follows a similar evolution in the topics studied over the course of the semester. Market topics examined include securitization, the money markets, the Treasury market, and the financial crisis.
LAW6431;;;Federal Courts;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;Prerequisite: Constitutional Law and second semester of Civil Procedure. Students without such background should consult with the instructor. Knowledge of the basic doctrines of administrative law is very useful, although not a strict prerequisite.;;;;;;This course examines the various constitutional, statutory, and judge-made doctrines that control access to the federal courts to vindicate federal rights. It is particularly valuable for those planning a career in public interest or the public sector, anyone else expecting to litigate extensively in federal court, and students who have or hope to obtain a judicial clerkship. Topics covered include: case or controversy limitations, including standing; constitutional and statutory limits on jurisdiction; causes of action for constitutional and statutory rights, including 42 U.S.C. SS1983 and Bivens actions; bars to such actions, including sovereign immunity and abstention doctrines; and habeas corpus.

LAW6441;;;Federal Income Taxation;;;3;;;Fall, spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;A basic course designed to develop understanding of tax concepts and ability to work effectively with the Internal Revenue Code, regulations, cases, and other tax materials.
LAW6451;;;Federal Indian Law;;;3;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;The course will focus on the basics of Federal Indian Law, the ever-changing body of case and statutory law and treaties that define the limits and extent of Indian tribal sovereignty in the United States in the late twentieth century. The course will explore the nature and extent of tribal sovereignty at the time of European contact, the changing strategies of the United States in relating to tribes, and the lasting impact of those strategies on current-day tribal communities and their rights of self-government. The course will also explore the role of the United States in protecting tribal sovereignty and tribal resources. It will also examine the powers and jurisdiction of tribal governments with regard to both members and non-members of the tribe, as well as the lack or extent, as the case may be, of state jurisdiction over activities on Indian lands. Students will be encouraged to continually identify and question the legal, political and moral basis of the laws and policies that constitute Federal Indian Law in the United States today. We will also examine the current ALI restatement project for Federal Indian Law.
LAW6461;;;Financial Institutions;;;3;;;Fall, spring.;;;;;;;;;NBA6460;;;An introduction to the regulatory structures, as well as some of the economic, technological and other factors, that pattern the conduct of financial intermediation in the U.S. The principal focus will be upon commercial banks, investment companies (mainly mutual funds), insurance companies, pension funds and securities firms in so far as these institutions discharge a common set of economic functions and give rise to a common cluster of counterparty and third party ("systemic") risks. Legal topics to be covered accordingly include entry-, functional and geographical restrictions; consumer-protection (including disclosure requirements) and competition-promotion; capital adequacy-, solvency- and related forms of risk-regulation (including deposit insurance); community-reinvestment; and "self-regulation." We shall also devote some attention to "alternative" financial service providers such as check-cashing services, community development financial institutions and micro-credit providers; and we shall take occasional note both of divergent (generally, non-American) jurisdictions' dominant modes of financial intermediation and of the "globalization" of finance, in order both to place what is distinctive about the dominant American forms into bolder relief and better to understand the forces operating behind recent and still unfolding changes to the American (and global) financial and finance-regulatory environments. No prior background in financial law or economics is required, but it is helpful.
LAW6501;;;Insurance Law;;;3;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;Insurance is an increasingly important tool for the management of risk by both private and public enterprises. This course provides a working knowledge of basic insurance law governing insurance contract formation, insurance regulation, property, life, health, disability, and liability insurance and claims processes. The emphasis throughout the course is on the links between insurance theory, doctrine, and modern ideas about the functions of private law.
LAW6511;;;Intellectual Property;;;3;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;A survey of legal mechanisms for protecting intellectual property including patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret and related state law doctrines.
LAW6514;;;International and Foreign Legal Research;;;2;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;The practice of law continues to become ever more dependent upon a clear understanding of the global context in which it occurs. This course provides an overview of sources, methods, and strategies for researching international and foreign law. Topics to be covered include the various legal systems of the world, public and private international law, the European Union, and the United Nations. The course will be delivered through lectures and hands-on exercises. Selected readings will be available online and on reserve; there is no required textbook. There will be a series of assignments and a final research project in lieu of a final exam. Foreign language ability is not required.
LAW6531;;;International Commercial Arbitration;;;3;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;A study of arbitration as increasingly the dispute resolution method of choice for international trade and transactional disputes (where the parties are from different countries). The course introduces the sources and hierarchy of norms governing international arbitration and then focuses on the legal issues and processes concerning enforcing agreements to arbitrate, selecting and challenging arbitrators, choosing the procedure and applicable law in arbitral proceedings, and enforcing the resulting arbitral award. The course gives special attention to the 1958 UN Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (and agreements to arbitrate) known as the New York Convention, and the UNCITRAL (U.N. Commission of International Trade Law) Model Law. The course's unique approach-patterned on the nature of international commercial arbitration itself-presents commercial arbitration as a transnational phenomenon and not as a subject based in or controlled by any particular national system. The course materials include court decisions, arbitral awards, national arbitration statutes, the rules of various arbitration institutions, and scholarly writings-drawn from all over the world.
LAW6563;;;International Mergers and Acquisitions;;;1.5-2;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;NBA5870;;;Addresses the principal business and legal issues in cross-border mergers and acquisitions, including forms and techniques of combining two businesses, negotiation, pricing and other economic terms, due diligence, issuance of securities, antitrust, duties of managers, and the resolution of employee and other social issues. The graded work is a written proposal for an M&amp;A transaction between two existing companies in different countries prepared by small teams. Proposals are based on publicly available financial, business, legal, and other documents and data and any other information obtained. The goal of the written work is to simulate the process in which business people, investment bankers, and lawyers work together to structure transactions across national borders. The reading covers the basic business and legal issues most frequently encountered in international mergers and acquisitions. Class discussion occasionally refers to the reading but generally covers other issues.
LAW6564;;;International Taxation;;;3;;;Spring.;;;;;;Prerequisite: Federal Income Taxation.;;;;;;This course examines the principles underlying the U.S. taxation of U.S. persons who earn income abroad and the U.S. taxation of foreign persons who earn income in the United States.
LAW6569;;;Introduction to Depositions;;;2;;;Fall, spring.;;;;;;;;;;;; 
LAW6570;;;Introduction to Chinese Law;;;3;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;This course is designed to provide students with an introduction to the nature and function of law in China. It will give future legal practitioners and persons who may fill offices dealing with China the knowledge they need to understand how successfully to interact with the Chinese legal system. The course is divided into three parts. Part I will briefly review the historical and theoretical foundations necessary for an understanding of contemporary Chinese law. Part II will provide an introduction to the current legal system of the People's Republic of China (PRC), with particular focus on major legal institutions and processes. Part III will examine selected issues in the substantive law of the PRC.
LAW6572;;;Introduction to Transactional Lawyering;;;2;;;Fall.;;;;;;Prerequisite or corequisite: Business Organizations.;;;;;;The conventional law school curriculum implicitly emphasizes appellate litigation, teaching students to read, argue and distinguish cases, and to predict what a judge will do. A transactional practice demands additional skills. A full understanding requires years of experience - not something that can be bottled into a one-credit course. Transactional Lawyering provides students with an initial introduction to how a deal is structured and what a deal lawyer does - familiarizing them with some common problems and the tools used to address them. In exploring these problems, the course draws on moral hazard, adverse selection, and other economic theories and applies them to real deal issues.
LAW6592;;;Labor Law, Practice and Policy;;;3;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;This course will focus on the federal laws regulating the organization of private-sector workers and unions and the process of collective bargaining in addition to addressing protected concerted activity unrelated to union organizing.  Issues of race, economic justice and immigrant workers will also be addressed. Practice in the field of labor and employment law will be highlighted along with important and timely public policy issues.
LAW6601;;;Land Use;;;3;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;This course will provide a broad introduction to the theory, doctrine, and history of land use regulation. Topics will include the meaning of ownership; theories behind land use controls; the private nuisance action; zoning, including the permissible content of zoning laws, contract and conditional zoning; vested rights, development agreements, and "ballot box" zoning; and constitutional limitations on government action in land-use controls,including takings law, the First Amendment, and due process challenges.  We will also consider current hot topics in land-use law, such as brownfields legislation, natural gas fracking, sprawl, conservative easements, historic preservation laws, and endangered species legislation. 
LAW6640;;;Law and Mental Health;;;3;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;The course will explore (1) the impact of neuropsychiatric disorders on emotion, cognition and behavior, (2) the admissibility and use of neuroscientific evidence in legal proceedings, and (3) the role of law in fostering effective treatment of individuals with neuropsychiatric disorders and in regulating conduct that violates or threatens legal and social norms. There are two goals. The first is to convey an appreciation of the complexities of diagnosing and treating neuropsychiatric disorders. The second is to address the challenges involved in accommodating the rights and interests of individuals whose conduct can be puzzling, distressing or dangerous to self or others. Readings will include a casebook on Law and the Mental Health System and handouts from legal and medical sources.
LAW6641;;;The Law Governing Lawyers;;;3;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;This course is intended to provide a comprehensive overview of the law governing lawyers in a variety of practice settings, including transactional, counseling, and civil and criminal litigation. The course is not focused merely on the ABA's Model Rules, but draws extensively from judicial decisions in malpractice and disqualification cases, the new Restatement of the Law Governing Lawyers, and other sources of law. A major theme is the relationship between state bar disciplinary rules and the generally applicable law of tort, contracts, agency, procedure, and crimes. Another significant theme is the prevention of attorney discipline and malpractice liability through advance planning.
LAW6661;;;Constitutional Law of the European Union;;;3;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;This course introduces students to the law and institutions of the European Union. It examines the composition, organization, functions and powers of the Union's governing bodies; analyzes the Union's governing treaties and constitutional law; and studies the Union's decision-making processes. The course also explores broader questions of political, economic and legal integration, such as the proper relation between the Union's law and the domestic law of the Union's Member states, and the desirability and feasibility of using the E.U. as a model on which to pattern other transnational agreements.
LAW6681;;;International Law and Foreign Direct Investment;;;3;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;This course studies legal aspects of direct foreign investments. It seeks to identify legal problems that are likely to affect a commercial investment in a foreign country. Inter alia, it deals with the public international law principles and rules governing the establishment by foreign businesses of various factors of production (persons and capital) on the territory of other states and the protection of such investments. Thus, the course includes a discussion of the following topics: economic development and foreign capital; obstacles to the flow of investments to developing countries; guarantees to investors and investment codes; bilateral treaties; nationalization; joint ventures; project financing; transfer of technology; arbitration; investment insurance; unification of trade law; and the settlement of investment disputes.
LAW6692;;;Legal Ethics-Oxymoron or Principles for a Successful Practice;;;2;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;The Model Rules of Professional Conduct were designed to cover the practice of law in all settings. However, the changes that have occurred in the practice of corporate law have in many instances tested the scope of the rules and have required thoughtful analysis by corporate lawyers to ensure their ongoing ethical behavior. Clients using multiple law firms depending upon the issue, lawyer mobility, and the continuing growth of the role of in-house counsel have each created consistent tensions. This course will examine these issues though actual examples, focusing on the scope of the representation, determining who the client or clients may be, the use of confidential information and when it must or may be disclosed, conflict resolution, the duties within the entity, the unique position of a law firm associate or corporate junior counsel, zealous advocacy and determining and resolving conflicts.
LAW6701;;;Legislation;;;3;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;Much of the "law" that lawyers work with is statutory. This course will examine both how legislatures go about doing their work (that is, legislative process) and how courts and others utilize legislative output (that is, statutory interpretation). We will begin with legislative process, focusing both on how laws are enacted and on the rules structuring legislative debate and behavior, including campaign finance regulation, lobbying regulation, and issues of "due process of lawmaking." We will then devote substantial attention to theoretical and practical issues in statutory interpretation, including theories of interpretation generally, the canons of construction, and the use of legislative history.
LAW6710;;;Law and Literature;;;3;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;ENGL3762;ENGL6710;GOVT6045;;;This seminar will study the relationship between law and literature to pose broad questions about the interpretive and other stakes of different theoretical approaches to literary criticism. We will consider frameworks for conjoining literature with law that are established (narratology, psychoanalysis, rhetoric) and new (cultural studies, performance, globalization), applying these analytics to specific issues (immigration, marriage, human rights) as well as literary texts. We will thereby investigate the evolution of law and literature as a field of inquiry, examining its institutional-intellectual genesis and its contemporary formations. While ranging across historical periods, we will in particular ask about the future directions of law and literature. To what emerging debates might law and literature scholars turn? What new methodologies and problems remain insufficiently explored?
LAW6730;;;Multicultural Work Environment I and II;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LAW6737;;;National Security Law;;;3;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;In the wake of 9/11, the question of American national security has been at the forefront of legal and political debate. This course will examine the current constitutional framework guiding national security institutions as well as its historical emergence -- especially in the late 19th century and during the early period of the Cold War. We will cover such themes as the allocation of power between Congress and the President on matters of foreign policy and war making, as well as the role of the judiciary in checking the political branches. Special attention will be paid to how key statutes have shaped national security practices, including the National Security Act, the War Powers Resolution, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, and the Military Commissions Act. The course will also explore such topics as the use of criminal courts for terrorism prosecutions, intelligence gathering and domestic surveillance, and American detention policy (treatment of unlawful combatants and prisoners of war) in the context of international humanitarian law.
LAW6738;;;Negotiation Skills;;;2;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;Attorneys in all practice areas negotiate frequently. Neither deal lawyers nor litigators can claim negotiation as "theirs" to the exclusion of attorneys in other practice areas. This course will provide students with an opportunity to learn and begin refining negotiation skills in various transactional and litigation settings. Students will engage in several negotiations during the course and will receive frequent feedback about their negotiations.
LAW6742;;;Patent Law;;;3;;;Spring.;;;;;;Prerequisite: An intellectual property survey course such as LAW 6511, is recommended but not required.;;;;;;This course will focus on U.S. patent law giving comprehensive coverage of doctrinal elements and touching on key policy issues. No technical background is required.
LAW6743;;;Selected Topics in Patent Law and Practice;;;2;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;This course will consider important assumptions that underlie much current day patent law and practice but are seldom articulated or critically analyzed. Students will consider the legal effect(s) of "public domain" status; the meaning of "invention" (which now includes at least some "business method" conceptions); the relationship between patent "claims" and patented "inventions;" conflicting standards for determining if a patent is valid or infringed; procedural devices that operate to limit or allocate adjudicatory authority in the patent system (e.g., judge versus jury; court versus agency); and intersections between patent law and principles of administrative, antitrust, federal court jurisdiction, personal property, tort, and unfair competition laws. Special attention will be paid to conflicts between precedent of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, a specialized court formed in 1982, and applicable Supreme Court patent precedent. The grade for the course will be based on a combination of class participation (20%) and five reaction papers (80%) of 600 to 800 words each (approximately 2 1/2 to 4 pages of typed, double-spaced text). A student may write up to six reaction papers, and in that case, the grade will be based on the student's five best papers.
LAW6752;;;Oral-Presentation Skills;;;1;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;This course examines effective ways to organize, summarize, and present information orally. With particular attention to the concepts of clarity, brevity, and audience, students will make - and critique - in-class presentations (including a moot-court argument) designed to inform and persuade the listener.
LAW6761;;;Principles of American Legal Writing;;;2;;;Fall, spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;This course provides foreign-trained lawyers with an introduction to the American legal system and essential principles of legal writing, analysis and legal research skills in the United States.

Students are given the opportunity to conference individually with the instructor and to re-write assignments after receiving the instructor's comments.
LAW6781;;;Products Liability;;;3;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;Applications of products-liability doctrine and theory to a variety of problems drawn from or closely approximating actual litigation. An overview of the relevant case law, statutes, and administrative regulations, including the Restatement, Third, of Torts: Products Liability.
LAW6782;;;Professional Responsibility for the 21st Century Practitioner;;;3;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;It will explore a variety of the legal, ethical and real-world issues commonly faced by modern lawyers in their daily practices, regardless of their specialties or the institutions in which they serve. It will address the relationship among the Model Rules of Professional Responsibility, the Restatement of Law Governing Lawyers and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. It will also focus on several noteworthy legal malpractice and securities claims in which lawyers and major law firms have become involved.

LAW6822;;;Social Science and the Law;;;3;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;This course examines the relationship of social science to law, focusing on the growing use of social science in the legal system. Over the past several decades, increasing numbers of social scientists have conducted systematic research on the operation of law and legal institutions. At the same time, social scientists themselves are testifying as experts in increasing numbers, encouraging lawyers and judges at both the trial and appellate levels to rely on social science evidence to decide cases. Social science research is also used as a tool in law reform. The aim of the course is to develop a critical analysis of these uses of social science in law and litigation. Are social scientists asking the right questions? Are lawyers, judges, legislators, and legal reformers using social science findings appropriately? Is the law's increasing reliance on social science problematic or advantageous -- or both?
LAW6841;;;Sports Law;;;2;;;Spring. (Ten weeks);;;;;;Recommended prerequisite: Antitrust Law and Labor Law.;;;;;;The course traces the development of sports law in the United States.

LAW7012;;;Advanced Criminal Procedure: Post-Conviction Remedies;;;3;;;Spring.;;;;;;Prerequisite or corequisite: Criminal Procedure is strongly recommended.;;;;;;This course examines the procedural and substantive law governing collateral challenges to criminal convictions in state and federal courts, and explores the tensions between the criminal justice system's competing interests in finality and production of reliable convictions and sentences. The course includes a historical overview of modern habeas corpus, studies substantive claims for relief common to collateral proceedings, and examines important procedural limitations on relief including the exhaustion requirement, procedural default, and no retroactivity. Much of the course will concentrate on the meaning, application and impact of the modifications to the federal habeas corpus statutes made by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996.
LAW7016;;;Colloquium on Law and Social Movements;;;3;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;When and why do social movements use the law instead of some other form of collective action? Under what conditions do they succeed and when do they fail? What does the law say about protest, and how does it structure the actions of contentious actors? How do waves of contention influence the law? This Colloquium will use a combination of theoretical, case, and historical materials to explore the intersection of law, lawyers, and contentious politics. It will engage with examples from a wide variety of areas, including civil rights, labor, privacy, and the conundrum of security v. liberty as well as assess comparative experiences in the United States and elsewhere.

Students will critique actual briefs, judicial opinions and oral arguments for technique and persuasive value. Guest speakers, including a judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and a federal prosecutor, will provide advice and recommendations. Students will apply what they have learned to the drafting of an appellate brief based on an actual court record. The brief will be written in stages and followed by one-on-one critiques. Students' will also present an oral argument. Initial practice arguments are critiqued by the professor and student panels (to permit students to see an argument from a judge's perspective), and the final argument is judged by the professor.

Topics include the nature of the law codes (e.g., hypothetical formulation versus statutory law), legal issues in the narratives (e.g., law of adultery and women's rights), law and morality (e.g., the Ten Commandments), law and religion (e.g., institutions guaranteed by the law but condemned by religious authority), the transformation of extralegal relations into legal ones (e.g., with the introduction of money), legal interpretation in antiquity (e.g., the Sermon on the Mount), social factors in legal development (e.g., shame and guilt), and aspects of criminal, family, and private law (e.g., an eye for an eye, incest rules, and unjust enrichment).
LAW7123;;;Chinese Law: Tradition and Modernization;;;3;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;This seminar offers an examination of how tradition and embedded cultural values have influenced the legal modernization in contemporary China. The focus of the seminar will be on the issues and dilemmas confronting China's ideal of empowering its state and people through the use of law. Topics will include the rule of law vs. the rule of Li (rituals and gifts), individual rights vs. collective interests, preference of informal justice over formal justice, cultivation of citizenship, growth of civil society, and the role of law in promoting the rights and interests of women, ethnic minority groups and disabled persons, and facilitating economic development. Interdisciplinary approaches will be employed in this seminar to facilitate understanding of Chinese legal tradition and its modern transformations, which include the efforts since the late 19th century of borrowing Western law and institutions and implementing current law reforms in the People's Republic of China (PRC). Readings are drawn from English translations of Chinese codes, cases and literary works, and academic writings by Western and Chinese scholars.
LAW7146;;;Comparative Legal Philosophy;;;3;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;This seminar introduces students to the philosophy of law from a comparative perspective, focusing on such topics as the concept of law, the nature of judicial reasoning, theories of justice and righteousness,morality and religion, rights and obligations, and theories of rewarding and punishment.

LAW7159;;;Deals Seminar: Bank Loan Transactions;;;3;;;Fall.;;;;;;Prerequisite: Business Organizations.;;;;;;This seminar explores how bank loans are used by businesses to finance acquisitions, growth and working capital needs.  A significant amount of time will be spent learning how to analyze and draft credit and security documents, and how specific contract provisions are employed to advance the business objectives of both borrowers and lenders.  We will explore the fundamental differences between bank loans and debt securities, and the ways in which the markets for these two kinds of investments are converging.  A particular area of focus will be how three areas of substantive law - secured transactions law, bankruptcy law and corporate law - come into play in the structuring and documenting of a typical secured bank loan.  We will also examine some of the legal and economic issues that arise when bank loans need to be restructured.
LAW7160;;;Deals Seminar: Law and Investment Banking - The General Counsel's Perspective;;;3;;;Spring.;;;;;;Prerequisite: Business Organizations.;;;;;;This seminar will focus on the legal and compliance issues faced by a large global financial institution, preparing students to advise financial institutions on issues arising in the current regulatory environment. We will begin with an overview of how an investment bank is organized, the role of the legal and compliance department and some of the key issues these institutions have faced over the last decade and in the current environment. Through the use of case studies, the seminar will investigate various real and apparent conflicts of interest, focusing on information barriers, the evolving role of the research analyst function, the research settlement, and Regulation FD. In addition, we will explore the issues surrounding internal investigations, highlighting the legal principles as well as practicalities involved in working with various stakeholders, including employees, regulators and investors. Additional topics include the capital commitment process, New Product review and approval processes, as well as key documentation issues.

The course also will include a session in New York where students will tour a global bank.
LAW7162;;;Contemporary American Jury;;;3;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;This course evaluates claims about the benefits and drawbacks of the contemporary American jury. Drawing on the work of legal scholars and social scientists, we will explore a range of topics relating to criminal and civil juries, including: jury selection; the use of jury consultants; juror perceptions of attorneys, evidence, and experts; individual and group decision making processes; jury instructions; jury deliberations; damage awards; juries in death penalty cases; and jury reform. By studying legal and empirical scholarship about the jury, and by writing their own research papers about a jury topic, seminar participants should develop insights into jury trial functioning and policy debates over the jury's role.
LAW7163;;;Deals Seminar: Financial Derivatives;;;3;;;Fall.;;;;;;Prerequisite: LAW 6131. ;;;;;;This seminar focuses on core derivative instruments - swaps, futures, options and other derivative financial instruments - that are regulated by the Commodity Exchange Act and related regulations. It examines the key terms and characteristics of swaps, futures, options and other derivatives, including how they are typically structured and used. The seminar also reviews the regulatory framework that governs these financial agreements, including the regulation of key market participants and key market structures. The seminar also will examine emerging legal issues involving derivatives, including coordination with international regulators and cross-border jurisdiction issues, the limits imposed by traditional confidentiality restrictions in an environment that is demanding greater information sharing for regulatory and other purposes, as well as enforcement issues, including fraud and market manipulation. The seminar will enable students to research specific issues related to the regulation of derivatives.
LAW7166;;;Deals Seminar: Capital Markets Transactions;;;3;;;Fall, spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;This seminar examines selected legal issues and documents in connection with capital raising transactions by companies and investment banks in the United States securities markets. Initial public offerings and offerings of investment grade and high yield debt securities will receive special focus. The seminar will review the essential aspects of equity and debt securities offerings such as the preparation of the prospectus, investor protection covenants in debt offerings, the indemnification and other key provisions of underwriting agreements, and the due diligence process.

LAW7170;;;East Asian Law and Culture Seminar;;;3;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;With many of the world's most dynamic economies now in East Asia, today's law graduates are more likely than ever to be involved with legal issues from that region. At the same time, legal problems in East Asia, from human rights, to judicial and legal education reform, to conflicts over labor, environmental and minority rights, to local debates about medical and scientific regulation and ethics, are invaluable sources of comparative insight about our own legal system. This seminar introduces students to the challenges and opportunities of studying law and culture in East Asia from a sophisticated interdisciplinary perspective. Students will participate in a semester-long colloquium and conference series on law and culture in East Asia in which Cornell faculty and guest speakers from around the world will present new research on current legal issues in the region. Students will be required to read a series of background materials in preparation for each seminar and to write six three- to five-page papers responding to the presentations. Everyone who wishes to take the course for credit must attend the first class.
LAW7174;;;Deals Seminar: Secured Transactions;;;2;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LAW7175;;;Deals Seminar: Drafting and Analyzing Corporate Agreements;;;3;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;This course is intended to familiarize students interested in a transactional practice with key provisions of significant contracts they may encounter. Its focus will be on clauses that are found in a variety of agreements, as well as what a corporate lawyer typically faces in addressing issues that arise in structuring and negotiating deals. The course does not address specialized areas (such as tax, intellectual property, environmental, labor, and employee benefits matters), but it will provide students interested in such a specialization with the context in which to better understand where their work fits into the bigger whole. Students will be expected to have read and thought about sample documents that will be discussed in class. Grading will be based on class participation and attendance, two drafting exercises, and a final examination. Professor Jacobs will teach a substantial portion of the course over videoconference.
LAW7195;;;Estate Planning;;;3;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;This course examines estate planning from simple testamentary planning to more sophisticated testamentary and lifetime planning. The course reviews the federal estate, gift and generation-skipping transfer tax, state transfer taxes and those aspects of income taxation pertinent to estate planning. The course will examine sophisticated estate planning in some detail, including qualifying dispositions for the marital and charitable deductions, postmortem planning, the use of valuation discounts, and techniques involving life insurance, closely held business interests, qualified plan benefits and individual retirement accounts, personal residences and qualification for governmental entitlements. The course will review issues in drafting Wills and trusts. The course will review planning for disability through powers of attorney and health care proxies. The course will review ethical considerations in the practice of estate planning and acting as a family counselor.
LAW7196;;;Europe and the United States: Fiscal and Political Choices and Economic Consequences;;;3;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;The purpose of this course is to examine the political and fiscal choices of Europe and the United States, and examine the economic consequences of them. The books chosen for study will be Boomerang by Michael Lewis, Currency Wars by James Rickards, The New Road to Serfdom by Daniel Hannan and Coming Apart by Charles Murray. One further book may be added. The format for the seminar will be to read the books, discuss them in class, and then write an essay about some aspect of the book being written about. The class will then discuss the various topics suggested by the papers. As Europe is further along the "social democratic path" than the United States, we will examine a number of developments taking place in Europe and seek to understand their implications as they relate to the United States.
LAW7197;;;Legal Scholarship;;;3;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;This seminar will teach the theory and practice of legal scholarship. Various sessions will include: study of "classic" works of academic legal writing; presentations of work by current scholars; multi-disciplinary training in some of the skills needed for the production of legal scholarship; critical discussion of the purpose and value of legal scholarship; and student development of their own papers. 
LAW7231;;;Ethnoracial Identity in Anthropology, Language, and Law;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;AMST6424;ANTHR6424;LSP6424;;;This course examines the role that both law and language, as mutually constitutive mediating systems, occupy in constructing ethnoracial identity in the United States. We approach the law from a critical anthropological perspective, as a signifying and significant sociocultural system rather than as an abstract collection of rules, norms, and procedures, to examine how legal processes and discourses contribute to processes of cultural production and reproduction that contribute to the creation and maintenance of differential power relations. Course material draws on anthropological, linguistic, and critical race theory as well as ethnographic and legal material to guide and document our analyses.
LAW7232;;;Ethical Issues in Criminal Investigations, Prosecutions and Policy;;;3;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;This seminar explores the role of government lawyers and defense counsel in complex investigations and prosecutions, including white collar criminal cases and matters involving terrorism. We will examine relatively recent cases and proceedings, including, for example: the disbarment of Michael Nifong, prosecutor of the Duke Lacrosse team members; cases and guidelines regarding disclosure in criminal cases; cases against criminal defense attorneys Lynne Stewart, Robert Simels and Arienne Irving; the KPMG case (United States v. Stein) and issues relating to deferred prosecutions. We will also address the role of government lawyers in advising on the treatment of detained persons during interrogation. In doing so, we will read declassified memoranda and reports written by and about lawyers from the Office of Legal Counsel of the Department of Justice on the use of torture in investigations conducted as part of the war on terrorism.
LAW7260;;;Federal Appellate Practice;;;3;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;This seminar will explore federal appellate practice in the Supreme Court of the United States and the federal courts of appeal from the perspective of a litigator with insights from the bench. The focus of the course will primarily be on procedural and substantive constitutional issues pending before the Supreme Court of the United States, but issues percolating in the federal courts of appeal may be addressed as well. Students will each argue two cases currently pending on the Supreme Court's docket, and will write one brief in either a pending Supreme Court or court of appeals case. Students will also participate as judges, with the faculty, in some cases and also, on occasion, be required to make a brief argument on short notice on issues raised in class.
LAW7293;;;European and U.S. Responses to the Global Financial Crisis;;;3;;;Spring.;;;;;;An understanding of European Union Law is strongly recommended. A good understanding of political economy is suggested.;;;;;;This course will examine the institutional and regulatory changes taking place on both sides of the Atlantic in response to the global financial crisis. We will consider the economic rationales underlying emerging regulatory responses, with particular attention given to the implications of far-reaching economic reforms and their impact on labor law and growth. The course will provide a guide to understanding the links between financial stability, competitiveness, labor law and the changing face of global markets.
LAW7311;;;Immigration and Refugee Law;;;3;;;Fall.;;;;;;Prerequisite: Constitutional Law.;;;;;;This course explores the evolving relationship between U.S. immigration policy and our national purposes. Immigration plays a central role in contemporary American life, significantly affecting our foreign relations, human rights posture, ethnic group relations, labor market conditions, welfare programs, public services, and domestic politics. It also raises in acute form some of the most basic problems that our legal system must address, including the rights of insular minorities, the concepts of nationhood and sovereignty, fair treatment of competing claimants for scarce resources, the imperatives of mass administrative justice, and pervasive discrimination. In approaching these questions, the course draws on diverse historical, judicial, administrative, and policy materials.
LAW7314;;;International Law / International Relations Colloquium (1/2);;;0.5;;;Fall, spring. (Yearlong);;;;;;;;;;;;This interdisciplinary colloquium, held at the law school and jointly offered with the Department of Government, invites scholars to present research related to international law and international relations.  The presented work will span a broad substantive and methodological spectrum, and may include empirical and theoretical material.  Students will be expected to prepare responses/comments for several speakers throughout the year and participate in the colloquium discussion.  This course is especially appropriate for students developing their own research agendas but is open to all students interested in the topic.
LAW7321;;;International Criminal Law;;;3;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;The seminar examines the questions surrounding international criminal law as a separate discipline and the sources of and basic principles underlying the subject. Particular attention will be paid to the question of jurisdiction over international crimes. It will consider international crimes such as aggression; war crimes, crimes against humanity, terrorism, and torture. It will also consider the treatment of past human rights violations in post conflict situations. It will further consider procedural aspects of international criminal law and the forums that deal with international crimes. In that context, it will look at the structure, jurisdiction and jurisprudence of Truth Commissions; the International Criminal Court (The Rome Statute); the former Yugoslavia Tribunal; Rwanda Tribunal and extradition and mutual legal assistance. The format will be class discussions of assigned readings. Final assessment in the course will be based on participation in class discussions and a written paper on a subject falling within the themes of the seminar. Paper topics must be submitted to the instructor for review not later than the third week of class. Each student is expected to give a presentation based on his or her paper to the class.
LAW7358;;;International Environmental Law;;;3;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;The development of international environmental law since the 1960s is a remarkable exercise in law making. This course will review this development, its legal foundations and fundamental principles. It will outline the framework within which the principles and rules of international environmental law apply. The framework comprises the legal nature of states, international organizations, non-governmental organizations, treaties and other legal instruments such as UN resolutions. The course will consider the adequacy of this legal system in addressing regional and global needs to achieve sustainability. Critical aspects of sustainability include: climate change, increasing frequency and magnitude of disasters including droughts and floods, marine resources, energy, biodiversity, genetic resources and associated intellectual property issues, and trade and economic development. These crosscutting challenges must balance conflicting goals of economic development and environmental sustainability. Such challenges involve basic considerations of human rights, such as the human right to water, and in particular the self-determination of indigenous peoples. A major component of the course will be individual projects selected by each student with the instructor's approval.
LAW7360;;;International Financial Regulation;;;2;;;Fall.;;;;;;No prerequisites although students should have taken Business Organizations in a prior semester or concurrently this semester.;;;;;;This is a unique seminar, offered by the former deputy CEO, General Counsel and member of the Executive Board of the Swiss financial markets regulator, FINMA. It provides an introduction to the international regulation of the financial markets. No prior familiarity with financial regulation is required. The course will begin with a basic review of the principal features and reasons for financial regulation, including consideration of the global financial crisis, as well as the anti-competitive and protectionists effects that financial regulation can have. The seminar will also discuss the principal bodies involved in international financial regulation, such as the Financial Stability Board and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, as well as their principal functions. A particular discussion will focus on the system and limits of the Basel Committee's Capital Standards and the role of the IMF in Financial Regulation. Conflicts of law and cross-border enforcement issues will also be studied, with a particular focus on recent examples, including in derivatives regulation, international bank resolution, the LIBOR-case and the Swiss-U.S. tax dispute. Short written papers and short oral presentations will be required.
LAW7371;;;Islamic Law and History;;;3;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;This course is designed to introduce law students to the terminology, principles, and concepts of classical Islamic law. After discussing the origins and evolution of Islamic law, we will turn first to the organization of qadi courts (procedure and evidence) and then to specific areas of the law, e.g., personal status (marriage and divorce), the intergenerational transmission of property (bequests, gifts, and endowments), commerce (contracts, hire, allocation of loss), and crime. The application of legal doctrine to actual disputes will be analyzed through the reading of expert judicial opinions or fatwas (in English translation) issued in connection with medieval and modern court cases.
LAW7375;;;Judicial Enforcement of Socio-Economic Rights;;;3;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;The purpose of the seminar is to introduce students to the complexities involved in the judicial enforcement of social and economic rights, in particular, the philosophical, democratic and practical concerns about the role of the judiciary in the enforcement of social and economic rights. These concerns arise sharply in the context of the inclusion of social and economic rights in a constitution that is to be interpreted and enforced by the courts. Is the enforcement of these rights by courts undemocratic? Does the inclusion of these rights in a constitution force courts to violate the principle of the separation of powers because in the course of adjudicating on these rights courts are invariably required to make decisions that have implications for the allocation of resources and the formulation of policy? Do courts have the institutional competence to make decisions that are polycentric in nature? To lay foundation for exploring these concerns, the seminar will consider (a) the foundation of social and economic rights; (b) the emergence of the international regime on social and economic rights; and (c) various methods use in national legal systems to protect social and economic rights. The debate on the role of the judiciary in the enforcement of social and economic rights will be explored in the light of judicial experiences in countries such as India, South Africa, United States and Northern Ireland.
LAW7412;;;Law and Humanities Colloquium;;;3;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;ENGL7412;;;In an era of increasing interdisciplinary collaboration, the fields that comprise the humanities are engaging in new ways with law as well as with each other, and projects developed within the context of law schools themselves bear renewed relevance to the humanities. This colloquium will bring together scholars working at the forefront of legal history, law and literature, law and culture, and critical theory from the institutional vantage points of both law and the humanities. Those who present materials will be asked to speak not only about their specific research but also to address where their work is situated within new developments in law and humanities as a whole. The course will begin with three weeks of seminar designed to apprise students of the history of law and humanities to date and to situate current developments within this history. We will, for example, read classics of the law and literature movement by James Boyd White and Robert Cover, then inquire as to how recent work-such as the essays in Victoria Kahn and Lorna Hutson's collection Rhetoric and Law in Early Modern Europe-might differ in approach. The rest of the course will be organized around a series of speakers, some drawn from Cornell and some from other universities. The students will convene for a half hour at the beginning of the session, which will then be opened to a larger community, including faculty members, for the talk itself. Students will be required to write six three- to five-page papers responding to the speakers' pre-circulated talks; these will be due in advance of the class session and shown to those lecturing in order to prompt and enhance discussion. Everyone who wishes to take the course for credit must attend the first class.
LAW7440;;;Law and Social Change: Comparative Law in Africa;;;3-4;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LAW7572;;;Litigation Drafting;;;3;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;This course focuses on drafting documents typically encountered during the pretrial phase of civil litigation. As drafters, lawyers must think strategically about, and understand the conventions unique to, each document. Students will have repeated opportunities to develop essential drafting and professional skills through a combination of in-class exercises and take-home writing assignments related to pleadings, motions, discovery requests, affidavits, demand letters, and settlement agreements.
LAW7578;;;Markets, Democracy, and the Rule of Law;;;3;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;The promotion of markets, the spread of democracy, and the promulgation of the rule of law are frequently presented as three interrelated goals at both the domestic and the international level. In this seminar, we will consider the multiple potential meanings embedded in these goals and the degree to which they may be complementary and/or in tension. The seminar will include a theoretical unit (considering, among other things, the degree to which the definitions of each of these elements are settled or contested) and a series of applications. We will discuss both academic scholarship and cases/case studies that highlight these issues. Students will write a paper for the course, and will also give a brief presentation to the seminar on their paper topic.
LAW7580;;;Markets, Morals, and Methods;;;3;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;This seminar is devoted to the foundations of choice, agency, and welfare -- matters that lie at the core of normative legal and economic theory. Readings, guest speakers, and class discussion will focus on the nature of preferences, reasons, and norms, as well as (a) their inter-relations and (b) their roles in guiding human decision and action. A central theme will be the question whether and to what degree welfare, well-being, and wealth for that matter can be understood apart from and even as determinative of normative propriety ("rightness" and "wrongness"), or whether instead these concepts presuppose a prior conception of normative propriety. Many legal and economic theorists seem to assume the former, but this assumption can -- and in this course will -- be examined critically.
LAW7592;;;The Military and the Law;;;3;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;In the decade since the devastating terrorist attacks of September 11th, our military forces have engaged in two long term wars in foreign countries as well as an ongoing struggle against the terrorist organization involved with those attacks. The legal issues both within the military and surrounding our military actions have risen to the forefront throughout the course of these conflicts. This seminar will explore those issues, taking a historical perspective on the evolution of the law as it intersects with the military while primarily focusing on the legal issues facing our country today. Topics will include a discussion of the military court-martial system as compared to the Article III civilian federal court system and the use of courts-martial to try non-military contractors employed in war environments. We will also examine the use of targeted killings and the detention of individuals in combat, including scrutiny of the developing case law regarding habeas rights for individuals the military has detained and the use of military commissions. This course is designed to elicit discussion from both a policy and legal perspective on these current issues while helping to broaden the students' understanding of how law impacts our military forces and how our military can be used to spread the Rule of Law. The course content will touch upon issues raised in criminal law, international law, national security law and the law of armed conflict. Students will be graded on two papers and their participation in classroom discussion.
LAW7631;;;Pretrial Practice, Litigation Strategies, and Remedies in Commercial Litigation;;;3;;;Fall.;;;;;;Prerequisite: Civil Procedure and Contracts or Anglo-American Contract Law.;;;;;;This seminar studies the strategies of complex commercial litigation, focusing on case development in the pretrial period. It will address strategies and approaches to pleadings, jurisdiction, motions, pretrial discovery and remedies (e.g., preliminary injunctions, damages) in the context of difficult and unclear legal issues. Hardball litigation techniques and ethical considerations will be considered as well as the use of litigation to achieve business goals. Actual litigated cases will be dissected and papers in the form of briefs and memoranda will be written on each. Since 90% of commercial cases settle before trial, this seminar will be a real life presentation of the commercial litigation process.
LAW7672;;;Race and the Criminal Justice System;;;3;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;This seminar will try to answer one of the most sensitive questions facing Americans today: Why are African Americans grossly over-represented in the American criminal justice system? Some answer this question with a simple accusation that the system is racist in design and implementation, and point to familiar statistics to buttress their claim. African Americans are eight times more likely to be incarcerated than whites. As of 2004, over 12% of African American men between the ages of 25 and 29 were in custody. For under-educated young black men, the incarceration rates are simply astounding: in 2000, nearly one in five African-American men under 41 who had not attended college were in prison or jail. Yet these statistics, as dispiriting as they are, must open the debate, not end it. While no one credibly doubts the persistence of racially biased decision-making throughout the criminal justice system, careful empirical research strongly suggests that overt discrimination plays a relatively modest role in producing the current state of play. The explanations for the disparities that haunt the criminal justice system are nuanced and complex, and therefore deserving of careful study. Absorbing lessons from a wide variety of disciplines, including history, sociology, political science, economics, and law, this seminar will try to shed light on this vexing American problem. Attendance, preparation, and participation are mandatory. Because the literature on this topic is voluminous, the readings for each class will range across a wide field. I expect the time commitment to be substantial. Still, there are no special course requirements. Grades will be based on class participation (15%) and a research paper (85%) due at the end of term. As part of the course, I will try to arrange a tour of a Maximum Security Prison, the timing of which will be determined once registration is complete and we have a roster of students. To accommodate the visit, the reading schedule may be adjusted as needed.
LAW7675;;;Issues in Financial Regulation;;;3;;;Spring.;;;;;;Recommended prerequisite: Financial Institutions.;;;;;;This seminar will seek to introduce students to a broad range of legal and regulatory issues that arise in connection with, and as a result of, financial innovation and increasing globalization of financial markets and institutions. Each semester, this seminar will explore in detail one or more of the key topics currently debated in academic and policy-making circles, which include the nature of risk in the global financial system, origins and resolution of major financial crises, theories of regulation and policy rationales for regulation of financial markets, and alternative approaches to regulatory reform in the financial services sector. Each student will be required to submit a research paper, which will form the basis for the final grade for the course.
LAW7690;;;Research Seminar: Shareholders, Sustainability, and Corporate Governance;;;3;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LAW7741;;;The Separation of Powers;;;3;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;The nature and consequences of our constitutional "separation of powers" is a topic of substantial debate, with significant implications for our system of government. This seminar examines the ways this concept is understood and used by modern judges, legislators, executive officials, and scholars to justify, or to attempt to modify, the distribution of power within contemporary American government.
LAW7755;;;Social Dilemmas in Legal Fact-Finding;;;1;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;Fact-finding is an important part of any legal proceeding, civil and criminal alike. The course deals with various social dilemmas that arise with regard to the way courts determine factual findings and how these dilemmas shape evidence law. The purpose of the course is to explore the basic concepts of evidence law and discuss some of the major theories of the field. The topics discussed in the course include: DNA evidence; the right to silence; previous sexual history of complainants in sexual offences; character evidence; statistical evidence in criminal and civil cases; cognitive psychological findings about human testimony; and using plea bargains to avoid evidential difficulties.
LAW7783;;;Topics in Intellectual Property;;;3;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;Sizable disagreement and controversy surround many areas of intellectual property. This seminar explores these disputes. By surveying the academic literature the seminar aims to introduce, understand, and ultimately critique the arguments being made for and against various aspects of intellectual property.
LAW7785;;;War Crimes Trials and the Law of Genocide;;;3;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;Beginning in November 1945, in an unprecedented attempt to bring war criminals to justice, more than 20 senior government officials and military leaders of Hitler's Third Reich were indicted and tried, in what has become known as the Nuremberg Trial, for crimes against peace, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. Earlier that fall, the SS commandants, officers and guards who had been arrested by the British upon the liberation of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, had been tried before a British military tribunal. These were the first of numerous trials of Nazi war criminals and related criminal and civil proceedings arising out of the Holocaust. This seminar will examine legal and ethical issues raised in these and other trials of Nazi war criminals and individuals accused of collaborating with the Nazis in perpetrating crimes against humanity, including the 1947 "Justice Trial" of Nazi judges and senior officials of the Third Reich Ministry of Justice, the Eichmann Trial in Jerusalem and the 1963-64 Tel Aviv trial of Hersz Barenblat, the head of the Jewish police in the ghetto of Bedzin, Poland. The course will also examine the history of the Genocide Convention, and the developing law of genocide and crimes against humanity with respect to atrocities in the former Yugoslavia, Rwanda and Darfur, including the evolving law on rape and sexual violence as a weapon of war.
LAW7793;;;Water Law;;;3;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;The aim of this course is to give a solid understanding of U.S. water law and an appreciation of the magnitude of its underlying economic stakes. The course examines the development of water law from its English common law roots including concepts of navigable waters, riparian rights and prior appropriation and doctrines governing the use of groundwater. The course will review major water programs in the Western states and consider the public trust doctrine, the role of federal law, particularly concerning reserved water rights of Indian tribes, the federal government's long history of promoting irrigation schemes through the Bureau of Reclamation, and federal flood control laws. In the Eastern states, the focus will be on water quality and its impact on water uses, including the application of the Safe Drinking Water Act to protect groundwater in New York City and if there is time the heavily litigated application of the Clean Water Act to the New York headwaters of the Chesapeake Bay watershed.
LAW7801;;;Immigration Appellate Law and Advocacy Clinic;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;Students will write appellate briefs to the Board of Immigration Appeals on behalf of clients who have petitioned to remain in the United States because they fear persecution or torture in their home countries. These clients will typically have represented themselves pro se in Immigration Court. During the first part of the semester students will learn substantive and procedural asylum and Convention Against Torture (CAT) law, such as the nature of persecution, grounds for asylum and CAT claims, and the practical and social effects that these laws have on new immigrants who seek asylum or CAT relief. Classes may also cover practical knowledge needed for effective representation, such as advanced research and writing skills. During the second part of the semester, students will work in teams of two on appellate briefs. These briefs will not only entail serious legal analysis, but may also require sociocultural and political research, so that the students can effectively write about the conditions of the client's home country. Students will interview clients over the phone during this time, with the possibility of face-to-face interviews. Some clients may be incarcerated, and many will be out-of-state. Students may also locate expert and other witnesses, and draft affidavits and motions. The students' cases will provide a basis for more in-depth substantive learning, as well as practical skills and attorney-client issues. In class, each team will also discuss the legal and practice issues that arise in their case, so that all students can benefit from and assist with each individual case.
LAW7805;;;Advanced Labor Law Clinic;;;3;;;Fall, spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;The Advanced Labor Law Clinic provides students another opportunity to deepen their understanding of traditional labor and employment law by representing the interests of workers with typical workplace issues. There is no classroom component to this course. Students will dedicate their time to addressing client inquiries related to organizing, collective bargaining, unfair labor practice charges, the Family Medical Leave Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act or other workplace issues. Students may also have the opportunity to represent their clients in a case before the National Labor Relations Board, in mediation or arbitration pursuant to the dispute resolution mechanism in the collective bargaining agreement. In addition to the domestic labor law inquiries, interested students may have the opportunity to address international labor law topics as well. The international labor law work typically occurs in Latin America. During the semester, there will likely be two guest speakers and two panel discussions on timely labor law topics, which students will be required to attend, along with weekly meetings to discuss case preparation and advancement. In this course students will advance the following skills: interviewing, counseling, factual investigation, legal research and writing, problem-solving and depending on the assignment, trial preparation skills (direct and cross-examinations, opening statement and evidentiary arguments).
LAW7811;;;Capital Punishment Clinic 1;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;Prerequisite: Criminal Procedure, Evidence, and the Capital Punishment Seminar are preferred but not required.;;;;;;Death penalty litigation: investigation and the preparation of petitions, memoranda, and briefs. This course is taught as a clinic. Two or possibly three capital cases are worked on by students. Case selection depends on both pedagogical factors and litigation needs of the inmates.

All students are included in discussions regarding the necessary investigation, research, and strategy for the cases.
LAW7812;;;Child Advocacy Clinic 1;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;Students will participate in the representation of children who are the subject of family court proceedings. Cases are likely to involve children who are the subjects of petitions such as: abuse or neglect, custody, termination of parental rights, status offense and juvenile delinquency. Students will interview clients and their families, prepare documents such as pleadings, motions, pre-trial memos and proposed findings of fact, and participate in court conferences and hearings. The in-class component of the course will address cross-disciplinary concerns such as working with other professionals and using social science to assist a client. Additionally, the course will focus on child development and the particular ethical concerns involved with the representation of children.
LAW7813;;;Child Advocacy Clinic II;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;Prerequisite: LAW 7812.;;;;;;Students in Clinic II will:1) work directly on law guardian cases, taking greater responsibility and working more independently than they are able to in the Child Advocacy Clinic I; 2) develop a more in-depth knowledge of the field of child advocacy by participating in a weekly reading group; 3) act as mentors for students in the Child Advocacy Clinic I, answering simple questions and providing emotional support for students who are often encountering, for the first time in their lives, stark poverty and violence; 4) act as liaisons between the students in the Child Advocacy Clinic I and the instructor, helping to identify areas in which the Clinic students need further instruction; 5) act as teaching assistants for Child Advocacy Clinic I, reviewing work products of the Clinic students and assisting them in locating research, formbooks, and samples of court documents.

Submit to Mary Newhart (mjn3@cornell.edu) a resume and a letter of interest within one week after the end of the pre-registration period. Include any experience in computer or information science, ADR or collaborative decision-making, web design or communication, statistical analysis, or videomaking, as well as substantive interest/experience in health policy, consumer financial products and/or financial regulation. (Such experience is not required; knowing about it helps us identify the incoming skill sets of the group.) Some preference will be given to students willing and able to do two semesters. President Obama's Open Government Initiative calls on federal agencies to increase transparency, participation, and collaboration in their decision-making. Use of Web 2.0 technologies and social networking tools to elicit public comment in rulemaking and other policymaking is especially emphasized. However, several significant legal, communications, and technological challenges exist. The e-Government Clinic, which grows out of the research of CeRI (the Cornell e-Rulemaking Initiative), engages students in theoretical development and practical application of principals of public law, deliberative democracy, conflict resolution, and collaborative decision-making in the contexts of Web-enabled rulemaking, regulatory review, and strategic planning. The primary research vehicle is an operational website, RegRoom.org, which features live public commenting moderated by Clinic students. For some students, travel to Washington DC to meet with the responsible agency may be required. Students are required to sign a non-disclosure agreement with every agency we work with during the particular semester.
LAW7838;;;Human Rights Advocacy at Home and Abroad;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;In this clinical course, students will work on projects that will expose them to diverse forms of human rights advocacy. The clinic is litigation-oriented, although clinic students may also be exposed to legislative advocacy and may have the opportunity to engage in fact-finding and research regarding human rights violations abroad. A current sampling of projects includes: (1) appellate advocacy on behalf of prisoners in Malawi who have been denied the right to counsel, and collaboration with lawyers in Malawi to reduce prison overcrowding and protect the rights of pre-trial detainees (in the past, a number of clinic students have traveled to Malawi to work directly with prisoners there); (2) representation of a prisoner at Guantanamo who was tortured by U.S. interrogators; and (3) working with lawyers around the world to promote the implementation of international norms regarding the application of the death penalty.

LGBT2350;;;Literature and Medicine;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;BSOC2350;ENGL2350;FGSS2350;;;How does literary language depict the experience of physical suffering? Can a poem or a novel palliate pain, illness, even the possibility of death? From darkly comic narratives of black plague and accounts of early modern melancholy to twentieth century critiques of the mental institution and depictions of the AIDS crisis, this course examines literature centered on medical practices from the early modern period through the twentieth century. Why have medical practices changed, and how do writers address their political, social, and ideological implications? Readings will include a broad range of genres, including poetry (Coleridge, Whitman), fiction (McEwan, Chekhov, Gilman, Kafka), theater (Kushner), nonfiction prose (Defoe, Woolf), and critical theory (Scarry, Canguilhem, Sontag).
LGBT2760;;;Desire;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;COML2760;ENGL2760;FGSS2760;PMA2680;;;"Language is a skin," the critic Roland Barthes once wrote: "I rub my language against the other. It is as if I had words instead of fingers, or fingers at the tip of my words. My language trembles with desire." Sexual desire has a history, even a literary history, which we will examine through an introductory survey of European dramatic literature from Plato and Aristophanes to Jean Genet and Caryl Churchill, as well as a survey of classic readings in Western sexual theory from the Ancient Greeks through Freud and Foucault to contemporary feminism and queer theory. Topics for discussion will include Greek pederasty, Christian mysticism, hysteria, sadomasochism, pornography, cybersex, and other performative pleasures.
LGBT2780;;;Body as Text: Pleasure and Danger;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;ENGL2780;FGSS2780;;;We experience our bodies as so much a part of who we are that we take them for granted. Yet the way we think about the body has a history of its own. This class looks at how the idea of "the body" gets constructed over time. How has the body come to have attributes called "gender," "sexuality," and "race"? Why have some bodies been seen as monstrous, perverted, and unholy, others as gorgeous, normal, and divine? What makes bodies pleasurable and dangerous? We'll find out by examining a broad range of evidence from the ancient era to the present day, including literature (Ovid, Kafka, Octavia Butler), philosophy (Plato, Descartes, Judith Butler), film, and the history of science.
LGBT3331;;;Gender and Sexuality in Southeast Asian Cinema;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;ASIAN3331;ASIAN6631;FGSS3331;FGSS6331;LGBT6331;PMA3431;RELST3331;;;Examines the new cinemas of Southeast Asia and their engagement with contemporary discourses of gender and sexuality. It pays special attention to the ways in which sexuality and gendered embodiment are at present linked to citizenship and other forms of belonging and to how the films draw on Buddhist and Islamic traditions of representation and belief. Focusing on globally circulating Southeast Asian films of the past 15 years, the course draws on current writings from feminism, Buddhist studies, affect theory, queer studies, postcolonial theory, and film studies to ask what new understandings of subjectivity might emerge from these cinemas and their political contexts. Films will be drawn from both mainstream and independent cinema and will include the work of directors such as Apichatpong Weerasethakul, Danny and Oxide Pang, Yau Ching, Thunska Pansittivorakul, Garin Nugroho, and Jean-Jacques Annaud.
LGBT3550;;;Decadence;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;COML3550;ENGL3550;FGSS3550;;;"My existence is a scandal," Oscar Wilde once wrote, summing up in an epigram the effect of his carefully cultivated style of perversity and paradox. Through their celebration of "art for art's sake" and all that was considered artificial, unnatural, or obscene, the Decadent writers of the late-nineteenth century sought to free the pleasures of beauty, spirituality, and sexual desire from their more conventional ethical moorings. We will focus on the literature of the period, including works by Charles Baudelaire, Edgar Allan Poe, A. C. Swinburne, and especially Oscar Wilde, and we will also consider related developments in aesthetic philosophy, painting, music, theater, architecture, and design.

It incorporates theoretical literature and content that is broader than that of Southeast Asia.
LGBT4270;;;Parody;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;AMST4805;FGSS4270;PMA4805;;;In A Theory of Parody, Linda Hutcheon defines parody broadly as "repetition with critical difference, which marks difference rather than similarity." Taking a cue from Hutcheon, we will consider parody as a form of meaning making that is not necessarily used in the service of ridicule. Rather, we will examine a number of late-twentieth- and early-twenty-first-century imitative works in order to distinguish the rich variety of political agendas and aesthetic rationales for recent parody. An emphasis on postmodern or contemporary performances and media that renovate images, ideas, and icons from modernism and modernity will unite our otherwise diverse efforts. Some of these efforts will also highlight what happens when an artist takes up a work made for one platform (for example, theatre, performance art, installation, cinema, television, the Web) and parodies it in another. Creators and works under consideration may range from Christopher Durang, Split Britches, and Pig Iron Theatre Company to The Simpsons, Cookie's Fortune, and Strindberg and Helium.

We will draw on texts that analyze misogyny in hip hop music and music videos, while also looking at how both mainstream and marginalized female hip hop artists contest sexually exploitative images of women. The course will utilize Black feminist theory, consumption theory, and youth culture theory to help students interpret and critique the ways in which women are represented in hip hop music, art, fashion, and dance, and in its surrounding culture. Considering analyses of African American, Caribbean, Asian-American, South African, and Latino interactions with hip hop, the course will investigate how youth construct gender and ethnic identities as they negotiate notions of African Diasporic belonging vis-a-vis hip hop. We will employ ethnographic, historical, sociological, literary, and interdisciplinary texts to explore questions such as: What do the sexual politics of rap music reveal about broader gender constructions? How can we compare the portrayal of women in hip hop to representations of women in related musical genres?  How are hetero-normative gender ideologies reinforced in hip hop culture? Does hip hop allow a space for alternative femininities? The course will also address broader questions related to representations of Black femininity, minorities in the media, gender and sexual identity construction.
LGBT4425;;;Representing Eros: Thailand;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ASIAN4425;ASIAN6625;FGSS4415;FGSS6625;LGBT6625;;;This course investigates the ways in which gender, sexuality, and desire have been thought of, written about, and depicted in Thailand as well as in the global imaginary about the country. While it draws also on historical cases, the course is primarily interested in examining key questions regarding sexuality, embodiment, and desire in the contemporary public sphere in Thailand. Thematic foci include notions of temporality, globalization, liberalism, space, nationalism, policy, and Buddhism. Students are encouraged to use the course to further develop their own research projects.
LGBT4800;;;Black Queer Studies;;;4;;;;;;;;;;;;ASRC4800;ASRC6800;FGSS4801;FGSS6801;LGBT6800;;;This course traces the genealogies and animating debates in black queer studies. Attentive to the relationship between black feminist criticism and black queer theory, this class proceeds with an understanding of gender and sexuality as intrinsic to the study of blackness in global contexts. Readings will include essays and books from Audre Lorde, E. Patrick Johnson, Christina Sharpe, Robert Reid Pharr, and others. Students will also engage popcultural texts, such as films, music videos, and novels to address the conjecture of blackness and sexuality in critical and vernacular discourse.

As we focus on African artists and theorists, we also read American and European theorists, including but not certainly limited to Giorgio Agamben, Michel Foucault, Roland Barthes, and Joseph Slaughter, detecting the ways in which discourses around bodies in the African context may shape contemporary theories and vice versa.
LGBT4992;;;Affective Ecologies;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;COML4026;ENGL4992;FGSS4992;SHUM4992;;;This seminar considers the points of intersection between theories of affect, emotion, and sexuality in recent queer and feminist thought, and the set of critical and cultural developments that has come to be called the "nonhuman turn." We will explore contemporary critical attention to the agential, sensory and cognitive capacities of the non-human, considering how this body of work reconfigures the relations between human and nonhuman worlds, and the more flexible and nuanced accounts of "nature" and "environments" that they make possible. At the same time, we will examine how the radically expanded ethos of being-in-common proposed by the non-human turn operates alongside the structures and histories of dehumanization to which and feminist, queer and critical race theory have drawn our attention.
LGBT4994;;;Archiving Sensation;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;COML4027;ENGL4994;FGSS4994;SHUM4994;;;This course will address the 2014-15 Society for Humanities theme of "sensation" through questions of method, focusing in particular on the interdisciplinary challenges of documenting and archiving sensation. Areas of focus will include: theory and practice of the archive from both queer studies and postcolonial studies; intersections of queer theory and affect theory that explore non-normative experiences of sensation, attachment, and intimacy; questions of genre and media, with particular emphasis on the limits and possibilities of "writing" sensation as opposed to representing it in other media, especially experimental and new media practices such as performance and art installation that are more explicitly embodied and/or material.

LGBT6472;;;The Problem with Rights;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;AMST6472;COML6472;FGSS6472;GOVT6776;HIST6472;;;In June 2013, in the space of a week, the Supreme Court ruled on affirmative action, the legacy of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, and the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). While the first two decisions were perceived as a step back in the fight against racial discrimination, the repeal of DOMA was welcomed by mainstream LGBT-rights organizations as a decisive move towards equality. One of the goals of this seminar is to think these rulings together instead of treating them as separate entities. How did the struggle for sexual rights and the promotion of color blindness come to coexist so easily within the law? In order to understand how liberalism has operated historically and theoretically as a crucial site of regulation for sexuality and race, we will read texts from a wide range of contexts and disciplines including political theory, anthropology, literature, philosophy, history, and law. Readings will include "classic" critics of liberalism such as Marx, Nietzsche, Althusser, and Foucault, and contemporary authors such as Wendy Brown, Elizabeth Povinelli, Lisa Duggan, David Eng, Janet Halley, Katherine Franke, and Jasbir Puar, among others.
LGBT6553;;;Erotics of Instruction;;;4;;;;;;;;;;;;ENGL6553;;;Instruction is a sensual experience with innumerable orientations: teaching, learning, analyzing, interrogating, suspecting, lecturing, suggesting, introducing, initiating, mentoring, indoctrinating, exhibiting, proving, disproving, discrediting, discovering, disavowing, and always, always discussing. We will discuss a range of classic texts on the relation of pleasure, power, and knowledge in the erotics of instruction, inside the classroom and out. We will begin with Plato's Symposium and trace its reimagination and critique through psychoanalytic, deconstructive, feminist, and queer theory. In this framework, we will explore works of erotic philosophy by Sigmund Freud, Jacques Lacan, Michel Foucault, Roland Barthes, Jacques Derrida, David Halperin, Jane Gallop, and Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, among others, as well as related works of contemporary cinema.

LING2285;;;Linguistic Theory and Poetic Structure;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;ENGL2960;ENGL6785;LING6285;;;Poems are among the most highly structured linguistic objects that human beings produce. While some of the devices used in poetry are arbitrary and purely conventional, most are natural extensions of structural properties inherent in natural language itself. The aim of this course is to reveal the ways in which poetry is structured at every level, from rhyme to metaphor, and to show how certain results of modern linguistics can usefully be applied to the analysis and interpretation of poetry. After introducing some of the basic concepts of modern phonology, syntax and semantics, it will be shown how literary notions such as rhyme, meter, enjambment and metaphor can be formally defined in linguistic terms. These results will then be applied to the analysis of particular poems and shown to yield novel and interesting insights into both their structure and interpretation.

LING3321;;;History of Romance Languages I;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;Prerequisites: a 2000-level (or higher) course in any Romance language, and some familiarity with a second one or with Latin.;;;ROMS3210;;;The Romance languages are the lasting imprint of all that happened to the Latin language as it moved through time, territories, and people of many ethnicities.  While the Latin of antiquity retained its prestige in high culture, the natural untutored usage of ordinary people was always free to go its own way.  This course covers the following topics, selected to create a panoramic view:  Formation of the general Romance seven-vowel system from Latin.  Early and widespread sound changes in popular Latin.  Finding and interpreting evidence for trends in popular Latin pronunciation.  The comparative method and its limitations.  Essential later sound changes, some of which ceate a whole new order of consonants unknown to Latin but conspicuous in Romance.  Nouns and adjectives from Latin to Romance.  Formation of the present indicative: the competing forces of sound change and analogical adjustment.  A brief overview of Portuguese.  Variants of the seven-vowel system.  Salient features of Romanian.  Factors that helped shape the vocabulary of Romance.  Medieval diglossia.

LING4421;;;Semantics I;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(KCM-AS);;;Prerequisite: LING 3303 or permission of instructor.;;;;;;Introduces methods for theorizing about meaning within generative grammar. These techniques allow the creation of grammars that pair syntactic structures with meanings. Students look at several empirical areas in detail, among them complementation (combining heads with their arguments), modification, conjunction, definite descriptions, relative clauses, traces, bound pronouns, and quantification. An introduction to logical and mathematical concepts used in linguistic semantics (e.g., set theory, functions and their types, and the lambda notation for naming linguistic meanings) is included in the course.

What is part of the grammar and what is a result of general reasoning? Pragmatics is often thought of as the study of how meaning depends on the context of utterance. However, it can be difficult to draw a line between pragmatics and semantics. In this course, we will investigate various topics that walk this line, including varieties of linguistic inference (including entailment, presupposition, and implicature), anaphora, indexicals, and speech acts.

LING6285;;;Linguistic Theory and Poetic Structure;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;ENGL2960;ENGL6785;LING2285;;;Poems are among the most highly structured linguistic objects that human beings produce. While some of the devices used in poetry are arbitrary and purely conventional, most are natural extensions of structural properties inherent in natural language itself. The aim of this course is to reveal the ways in which poetry is structured at every level, from rhyme to metaphor, and to show how certain results of modern linguistics can usefully be applied to the analysis and interpretation of poetry. After introducing some of the basic concepts of modern phonology, syntax and semantics, it will be shown how literary notions such as rhyme, meter, enjambment and metaphor can be formally defined in linguistic terms. These results will then be applied to the analysis of particular poems and shown to yield novel and interesting insights into both their structure and interpretation.

LSP1800;;;Immigration in U.S. History;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;AMST1800;HIST1800;;;This course examines immigration as a major theme in U.S. history and culture. We will discuss immigration in different periods of our national history, and in different locations, from Boston and New York to San Diego, San Francisco, and Honolulu. We will also examine these migrations in a global context since they were part of a worldwide migration that affected millions of people. Lectures, readings, and discussions will examine popular, legal, and political responses to immigration, as reflected in legislation and policy, as well as film, art, literature, and the print media.
LSP2010;;;Latinos in the United States;;;3-4;;;Spring.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;AMST2655;DSOC2650;SOC2650;;;Exploration and analysis of the Hispanic experience in the United States. Examines the sociohistorical background and economic, psychological, and political factors that converge to shape a Latino group identity in the United States.

Special attention to Latino and other minority populations.
LSP2251;;;U.S. Immigration Narratives;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;AMST2251;HIST2251;;;Americans are conflicted about immigration.  We honor and celebrate (and commercialize) our immigrant heritage in museums, folklife festivals, parades, pageants, and historical monuments. We also build fences and detention centers, and pass more and more laws to bar access to the United States. Polls tell us that Americans are concerned about the capacity of the United States to absorb so many immigrants from around the world. How often have we heard the laments "Today's immigrants are too different. They don't want to assimilate" or "My grandparents learned English quickly, why can't they?" The assumption is that older generations 'Americanized' quickly but that today's immigrants do not want to assimilate. Did 19th century immigrants really migrate to the United States to "become Americans"? Did they really assimilate quickly? Are today's immigrants really all that different from the immigrants who arrived earlier? Why do these particular narratives have such power and currency? This seminar will explore these issues and help students discern fact from fiction.
LSP2300;;;Cultures and Communities;;;1-3;;;Fall, spring.;;;;;;;;;LSP4300;;;Conceived as a service-learning course, the centerpiece here is targeted, engaged research and arts work with Latino/a culture-related organizations in Tompkins County like Cultura! No mas lagrimas, and the Latino Civic Association. The core idea is that students will learn while participating in meaningful activities that will enhance arts and culture partnerships.

Credit is variable depending upon the student's role in play production: a minimum of 50 hours of work is required for 1 credit; a maximum of 3 credits are awarded for 100 hours or more of work.
LSP3065;;;Immigrant America: Race and Citizenship in Modern Working-Class History;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;AMST3065;ILRLR3065;LATA3065;;;Immigration discourse and policy has played a central role in shaping the modern American nation-state, including its composition, values, and institutions. This course begins in the late nineteenth century, defining it as a pivotal moment in U.S. immigration and labor history when efforts to regulate immigrant entry and naturalization became increasingly bureaucratized. As part of the course we will examine the causes and consequences of working-class migration to the United States from a comparative historical, ethno-racial, class-based, and gendered perspective. We will also address questions regarding the perceived benefit and cost of immigration at both the national and local (i.e., community) levels. In this sense, we will explore the economic, social, cultural, and political impact immigrants have had on the United States over time. Finally, we will consider how immigrants have negotiated the pressures of their new surroundings, and challenged dominant conceptions of American national identity and citizenship in the process.
LSP3068;;;Organizing for Immigrant Worker Rights;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;ILRLR3068;;;This class examines the institutional processes of enforcing immigrant worker rights. We begin by reviewing the legal foundations of immigrant labor, including the current immigration enforcement regime, and the role of legal status in labor standards enforcement protections.  We examine how organized labor has evolved with regards to immigrant workers, shifting from supporting employer sanctions in 1986, to repudiating them as a tool for employer control in 2001.  We then evaluate the role that immigrant workers have played in the revitalization of the labor movement, and the challenges that remain for unions.  Beyond unions, we examine the emergence of new forms of worker representation, including the varying types of worker centers.  We focus on the proliferation of day labor centers, and more recently, non-union efforts to organize workers in the restaurant industry.  We even consider the role of undocumented workers in the public sector, made possible through the increased use of subcontracting. We look at how public entities have turned to worker organizations to help hold employers accountable, and how workers have turned to local governments to strengthen worker protections (such as higher minimum wages and strengthened penalties for wage theft), as well as how states have become new targets for policy change  (such as recent victories for domestic workers).  We also discuss binational efforts to advance immigrant worker rights.  We end by considering prospects for federal immigration reform, and the implications these proposals may have for immigrant worker rights.
LSP3400;;;Being and Becoming Black;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;AMST3402;ANTHR3400;ASRC3400;;;This course is about being Black throughout the Atlantic world. What constitutes Blackness? What experiences, cultural understandings and social problems shape the identities of people of African descent? In order to address these questions, the course focuses on the people who were relocated by the Atlantic slave trade to the Caribbean, South and Central America, and the United States, and on their subsequent migrations. We will explore the disparate cultural, national, historical and intellectual contexts in which Black identities are constructed, revealing both commonalities and differences. Paying specific attention to how racial identity is shaped by social context, the course will interrogate theories of Black identity formation and notions of Black nationhood, and will examine different perspectives on Diaspora theory. While readings are interdisciplinary in approach, our understandings of Blacks in the Atlantic world will be informed by ethnographic, historical and literary texts covering many cultural contexts including the U.S., England, Kenya, South Africa, Haiti, Puerto Rico, Brazil, Jamaica and the Dominican Republic. Students are urged to choose research topics early in the term from a variety of subjects including music, fashion, religion, literature, politics, sports, etc.
LSP3405;;;Multicultural Issues in Education;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;AMST3405;ANTHR3405;EDUC3405;;;This course explores research on race, ethnicity and language in American education. It examines historical and current patterns of school achievement for minoritized youths. It also examines the cultural and social premises undergirding educational practices in diverse communities and schools. Policies, programs and pedagogy, including multicultural and bilingual education, are explored.
LSP3672;;;Visualizing el Barrio: Interpreting and Documenting East Harlem's Mural Tradition;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;AMST3672;ARTH3670;ENGL3672;VISST3670;;;Visualizing El Barrio immerses students in a semester-long contemplation and class project that integrates artistic praxis with art history and literary studies to document the historical murals of East Harlem, otherwise known as Spanish Harlem or "El Barrio."  These murals tell stories about people, places, and events that resonate with El Barrio's predominantly Latino/a community and American culture more broadly.  The murals in East Harlem emerge out of a rich Latin American artistic tradition that migrated with the people who comprise the U.S. Latino/a diaspora. Through student research and documentation, "Visualizing El Barrio" will also participate in the preservation of East Harlem's historical murals, culminating in a celebration of the artwork with a student-curated exhibit of photographs and presentations.
LSP3777;;;The United States;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;AMST3777;ANTHR3777;;;The anthropological inquiry into one's own culture is never a neutral exercise.  This course will explore issues in the cultural construction of the United States as a "pluralistic" society.  We will look at the ideological context for the production of a cultural profile predicted upon ideas that are intrinsic to American images of identity such as individualism, freedom, and equality and the way these are applied in practice.  The course readings will include historic documents and accounts, popular writing, and recent ethnographies on the United States.
LSP3800;;;Latinos in U.S. History;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;AMST3830;HIST3800;;;How would our understanding of U.S. History change if we began the national narrative in 16th century New Mexico rather than 17th century Virginia? What does U.S. history look like when examined as hemispheric history? What if we were to bring the periphery to the center and examine U.S. History from the vantage point of the colonized and the immigrant, the exile and the transnational? This course seeks to reframe U.S. history by reconstituting what we understand as "American" history. We will examine territorial expansion and empire, migration and nation building, industrialization and labor, war and revolution, and citizenship and transnationalism in the "American experience" broadly defined to include americanos of Spanish, Mexican, Caribbean, and Central/South American ancestries.
LSP3835;;;Claiming Individual Worker Rights: Promises and Challenges;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;ILRLR3835;ILRLR6835;LSP6835;;;This course examines the experiences of workers attempting to navigate the labor standards enforcement bureaucracy. We begin by reviewing the conditions of post-industrial labor in an era of declining unionization and weak federal and state protections. Next we review theories of legal consciousness and legal mobilization, which help explain the conditions under which low-wage workers learn about their rights and come forward to demand justice.  We walk through claimsmaking in an array of federal and state administrative bureaucracies, including wage and hour, health and safety, and discrimination.  We also look at how the immigration enforcement regime intersects with the tenets of at-will employment to grant employers wide latitude in retaliating against undocumented workers and stifling attempts at legal mobilization.  We next assess how these formal protections are filtered through various institutional gatekeepers (including legal advocates and medical experts) and how organizational compliance structures (such as human resources and mediation programs) have limited worker's ability to make claims on their rights.  We consider how intersecting bases of inequality (such as gender, race, and national origin) are processed by administrative bureaucracies, and how lay versus legal conceptions of workplace justice often diverge.  We end by considering the fallout of workplace abuse on individuals and their families.
LSP4000;;;Contemporary Issues in Latin - Latino America;;;1;;;Fall, spring.;;;;;;;;;LATA4000;LATA6000;LSP6000;;;An exploration of critical topics in the anthropology, art, economics, history, literature, political science and sociology of Latin American and U.S. Latino contexts. Course features guest speakers from Cornell and other institutions.
LSP4080;;;Seminar in Dance Studies;;;4;;;;;;;;;;;;AAS4080;AMST4080;PMA4080;VISST4580;;;This seminar format course surveys the particular topic -- choreography -- with special attention to theories and practices of race and anti-racism. It introduces dance-based critical thinking, critical viewing, and research writing through written texts, recorded music and embodied performances mostly located in North America. Canonical and emergent dance research texts serve as principle lenses through which seminar discussions, presentations, and workshops, and writing will emerge. This specialized course takes students through a broad yet interconnected range of themes including racial formation and choreography theory, whiteness, Black dancing bodies, Latinidad, choreographing Asian America, and indigenous dance. Throughout the course students engage in interdisciplinary discussions on the racialized body, close readings of dance texts, and analyses of performances. Students will then be challenged to demonstrate their own original analyses through in-class activities, discussion, and a research paper.

Drawing upon texts, media, and theory generated from South Asia and Latin America, the course will develop new comparative approaches to the constitutive role that bodies play in creating, maintaining, and imagining borders in the global South.
LSP4369;;;Performing Latinidades;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;COML4369;COML6349;LATA4369;LSP6349;;;This seminar focuses on Latino/a performance within a variety of genres, including drama, film, music, and performance art. The "new global condition" between US Latino/as and Latin America guides our inquiry into local, national and transnational cultural practices. We begin by looking at theoretical work by scholars like Augusto Boal, Bertolt Brecht, and Diana Taylor that help us to better understand the political and social dimensions of performance. Using these frameworks as a point of departure, we examine a range of particular issues that connect diasporic Latino communities around specific cultural practices, including the politics of claiming space, the making of a Latina/o public sphere, transnational and multilingual imaginaries, cultural production and consumption, and alternative/subversive performance practices.  Texts may include works by authors like Carmelita Tropicana, Guillermo Gomez-Pena, Victor Hugo Rascon Banda, Nilo Cruz, Miguel Pinero, and Cristina Michaus.
LSP4620;;;Building a Verbal-Visual Movement: Chicano/a & US Latino/a Art Stories;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;AMST4301;ENGL4620;;;This seminar focuses on Chicano/a and U.S. Latino/a art movements in the 1960s and 1970s. We will examine their different and interrelated social, political, and economic origins within a larger civil rights movement, as well as their aesthetic, literary, and cultural legacies in the twenty-first century. Theorizing that Chicano/a and U.S. Latino/a artists built a verbal-visual architecture for the civil rights platforms of the 1960s and 1970s, we will examine visual icons, verbal slogans, motifs, and sounds that created and fortified an exciting and complex lexicon, visual culture, and poetics of an American experience. Students will also learn about and engage archives and special collections at Cornell and other institutions that house extensive works from this prolific era of artistic and cultural production. Artists, poets, and authors include: Jose Montoya, Yolanda Lopez, Pedro Pietri, Patssi Valdez, Asco, Miguel Pinero, Sandra Maria Esteves, Luis Valdez, Ester Hernandez, Alfredo de Batuc, Carmen Tafolla, and others.
LSP4851;;;Refugees;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;AMST4851;HIST4851;;;Since World War II, over 4 million people have migrated to the United States as refugees. In this seminar we will examine some of these refugee migrations and the ways these migrations challenged our understanding of the United States as a "haven for the oppressed." We will examine the crafting of refugee/asylum policy, the role of nongovernmental actors in influencing policy, and the ways policy reflected foreign-policy interests and security concerns. The last weeks of the course will pay particular attention to our changing definitions of who 'merits' asylum in the United States since the end of the Cold War.
LSP6000;;;Contemporary Issues in Latin-Latino America;;;1;;;Fall, spring.;;;;;;;;;LATA4000;LATA6000;LSP4000;;;An exploration of critical topics in the anthropology, art, economics, history, literature, political science, and sociology of Latin American and U.S. Latino contexts.

LSP6424;;;Ethnoracial Identity in Anthropology, Language, and Law;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;AMST6424;ANTHR6424;LAW7231;;;This course examines the role that both law and language, as mutually constitutive mediating systems, occupy in constructing ethnoracial identity in the United States. We approach the law from a critical anthropological perspective, as a signifying and significant sociocultural system rather than as an abstract collection of rules, norms, and procedures, to examine how legal processes and discourses contribute to processes of cultural production and reproduction that contribute to the creation and maintenance of differential power relations. Course material draws on anthropological, linguistic, and critical race theory as well as ethnographic and legal material to guide and document our analyses.

We next assess how these formal protections are filtered through various institutional gatekeepers (including legal advocates and medical experts) and how organizational compliance structures (such as human resources and mediation programs) have limited worker's ability to make claims on their rights.  We consider how intersecting bases of inequality (such as gender, race, and national origin) are processed by administrative bureaucracies, and how lay versus legal conceptions of workplace justice often diverge.  We end by considering the fallout of workplace abuse on individuals and their families.

We will examine general questions on literary analysis and the relationship between literature and history around certain events, such as medieval multicultural Iberia, the creation of the Spanish Inquisition in the 15th century and the expulsion of the Jews in 1492; the encounter between the Old and the New Worlds; the 'opposition' of high and low in popular culture, and of the secular and the sacred in poetry and prose. Readings may be drawn from medieval short stories and miracle collections; chivalric romances, Columbus, Lazarillo de Tormes, Cervantes, Lope de Vega, Calderon, and Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz, among others.
MEDVL2217;;;History of the English Language to 1300;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;ENGL2170;LING2217;;;Explores the development of the English language from its Indo-European beginnings through the period of Early Middle English. Topics include linguistic reconstruction, changes in sound, vocabulary and grammatical structure, external influences, and Old and Early Middle English language and literature.
MEDVL2400;;;Cultures of the Middle Ages;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;FREN2400;;;This course introduces students to one of the major concerns of the literature, art, and religious thought of western Europe between roughly 400 and 1400 AD: transformation. We'll begin with Ovid and Apuleius, the classical and late-classical myth-makers who literally wrote the books on metamorphosis. We'll then look at Augustine's  Confessions - where Christian conversion  becomes an even more startling kind of transformation - before proceeding to the stories of shape-shifters gathered together by the twelfth-century French poet Marie de France.  Then we'll take a look at Dante's account of metamorphosis as retribution in Inferno, as well as the kinds of transformations fantasized in the margins of medieval manuscripts, as Michael Camille describes them in Image on the Edge. We'll finally take the time to engage with both the transfiguration of Christ in medieval thought and its close analogue, stigmatization, as undergone most famously by Francis of Assisi. In the process, we'll ask what happens when the human is transformed into the divine.
MEDVL2740;;;Scottish Literature;;;3-4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;ENGL2740;;;Although Scotland, which was long a separate nation, is now politically united with England, it preserves its distinctiveness. This course provides an introduction to Scottish literature, with special emphasis on the medieval period and the 18th through the 20th centuries. The course should appeal to those who wish to learn about their Scottish heritage, and also those who simply wish to encounter a remarkable national culture and the literature it has produced. Some of the texts will be read in Scots, but no familiarity with Scots or earlier English is presumed. We welcome readers of literature who are not English majors.
MEDVL3050;;;History of the Book;;;3;;;;;;;;;;;;ENGL3050;;;This course provides an overview of the book as a material and cultural artifact. Focusing on the era of the printed book (1450-2000) in Western Europe and America, we will examine the invention and spread of printing and publishing, and the evolution of book design, illustration, and binding. The course will place an emphasis on practical tools for the identification and analysis of books and other printed artifacts, especially for literary students. Investigations and assignments will be built around hands-on interaction with examples of Cornell Library's rare books and manuscripts.
MEDVL3080;;;Icelandic Family Sagas;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;ENGL3080;;;An introduction to Old Norse-Icelandic mythology and the Icelandic family saga-the "native" heroic literary genre of Icelandic tradition. Texts will vary but will normally include the Prose Edda, the Poetic Edda, Hrafnkels Saga, Njals Saga, Laxdaela Saga, and Grettirs Saga. All readings will be in translation.
MEDVL3110;;;Old English;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;ENGL3110;ENGL6110;MEDVL6110;;;In this course, we will read and discuss some of the earliest surviving English poetry and prose. Attention will be paid to (1) learning to read the language in which this literature is written, (2) evaluating the poetry as poetry: its form, structure, style, and varieties of meaning, and (3) seeing what can be learned about the culture of Anglo-Saxon England and about the early Germanic world in general, from an examination of the Old English literary records. We will begin by reading some easy prose and will go on to consider some more challenging heroic, elegiac, and devotional poetry, including an excerpt from the masterpiece Beowulf. The course may also be used as preparation for the sequence ENGL 3120/ENGL 6120.
MEDVL3120;;;Beowulf;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;Prerequisite: one semester of Old English or equivalent.;;;ENGL3120;ENGL6120;MEDVL6120;;;A close reading of Beowulf.

MEDVL3140;;;Love and Ecstasy: Forms of Devotion in Medieval English Literature;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;ENGL3140;;;What do love, torture, and ecstasy all have in common? How could they all be considered spiritual experiences? The thirteenth century brought a new and intense focus on the body of Christ, bloodied, wounded, and tortured. Female and male mystics began to describe Jesus as a lord, lover, and even mother in most intimate--and even sexual--terms. Guides for meditation, memory work, and holy living focused on bodily practices for approaching the divine and replicating the suffering of Christ. In this course we will explore a range of literary texts and artistic representations that illuminate this religious and aesthetic ethos. Readings will be in modern and medieval English, and will also include contemporary theoretical texts.
MEDVL3190;;;Chaucer;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;ENGL3190;;;Chaucer became known as the "father of English poetry" before he was entirely cold in his grave. Why is what he wrote more than six hundred years ago still riveting for us today? It's not just because he is the granddaddy of this language and its literature; it's because what he wrote was funny, fierce, thoughtful, political, philosophical and, oh yes, notoriously bawdy. We'll read some of Chaucer's brilliant early work, and then dig into his two greatest achievements: the epic Troilus and Crisyede, and The Canterbury Tales, his oft-censored panorama of medieval English life. Chaucer will be read in Middle English, which will prove surprisingly easy and pleasant.
MEDVL3200;;;The Viking Age;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;HIST3200;;;This course aims to familiarize students with the history of Scandinavia, ca. 800-1100 ad. Although well known as a dramatic chapter in medieval history, this period remains enigmatic and often misunderstood. Our goal will be to set Norse history within its European context, observing similarities with processes elsewhere in the medieval world, the better to perceive what makes the Norse unique. We will examine the social, economic and political activities of the Norsemen in continental Scandinavia, in Western and Eastern Europe, and in the North Atlantic.

MEDVL3510;;;Machiavelli;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;HIST3510;ITAL3510;;;This course presents Machiavelli in a variety of historical and interpretive contexts; European and Italian politics in the early sixteenth century; the decline of the Florentine republic and the rise of the Medicean principate; Machiavelli's career in government and his, and the republic's, crisis in 1512-13; the intellectual traditions of Renaissance humanism, political thought, and the revival of antiquity; vernacular literary currents and popular culture; and the political writers and theorists with whom Machiavelli associated and corresponded. Emphasis is placed on a close reading of the major works (including the letters, The Prince, the Discourses, Mandragola, and selections from The Art of War and the Florentine Histories, all in translation) and a critical examination, in the light of that reading, of some major modern interpretations of Machiavelli.
MEDVL3637;;;History and Literature of Early Christianity;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;CLASS3637;JWST3637;NES3637;NES6637;RELST3637;;;This course traces the historical development of Christianity from its roots in 1st century Palestinian Judaism to the emergence of Islam in the early 7th century, with special emphasis on the period prior to the "conversion" of Constantine in the 4rth century. The focus will be on exploring the rich diversity of Christianity in late antiquity by reading a wide range of primary literary sources, including selections from the New Testament, church fathers, apocryphal writings, gnostic literatures, saints lives, and much more. In addition, we will study the material culture of early Christianity through archaeology, art, inscriptions, and papyri. Special attention will be given to the varieties of Christianity and the ways in which various forms of Christianity in different regions around the Mediterranean interfaced with paganism, Judaism, and Islam.

MEDVL4161;;;Literature of the Crusades;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;ENGL4161;ENGL6161;MEDVL6161;;;The Crusades occupied brief periods, with events far from most Western writers, but kept a long hold on European historical, religious, and literary imagination. This provides an opportunity to consider how literature responds to ideological and military conflict. Exploring the ideas leading to the Crusades, and some narratives from those directly involved, from the Chanson de Roland to other French and Latin chronicles and poems, the course will consider a wide span of later Middle English literature from romances to the works of Chaucer and his contemporaries in order to reconsider the imprint of the Crusades on the wider English literary tradition. Goals include gaining proficiency in Middle English and its literature, as well as theories of how narrative responds to cultural and ideological crisis.
MEDVL4180;;;The Imaginary Jew: Roots of Antisemitism in Medieval England;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ENGL4180;ENGL6180;JWST4180;JWST6180;MEDVL6180;;;When did anti-Semitism begin? The medieval period invented shocking fictions about Jews--that they killed and ate Christian babies; that they desecrated the Host; that they were the murderers of Christ. In manuscripts Jews were visually compared to beasts, devils, and perverts. By law, Jews were forced to live in ghettos, wear distinctive dress, abstain from certain professions, and suffer exile. Beginning with Shakespeare's Shylock, we will work our way back through visual and literary treatments of Jews in the Middle Ages, reading texts by Chaucer, chronicles, miracle stories, crusader romances, and mystery plays. Drawing on recent theories of the other we will also consider how medieval representations of Jews and other minorities were used to construct medieval communal, religious, and political identities.

Likewise, the mockery or destruction of these monuments is seen as a potent act of political resistance. These phenomena, together with the related concept of "propaganda," have exerted a strong influence on the interpretation of pre-modern ruler portraits. This course will encourage students to think critically about visual cultures of political rule and to develop an account of the distinctions between ancient, medieval, and modern modalities of ruler portraiture and its reception. Our primary case studies will be the late Roman and Soviet states, with ample comparative material drawn from other polities.
MEDVL4557;;;Desert Monasticism;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;CLASS4677;JWST4557;NES4557;RELST4557;;;How and why do landscapes come to inspire the religious imagination? And how do sensory landscapes, more specifically-territories of sight, sound, touch, taste, and smell-inform, inflect, and engage the religious imagination? When and why do religious practices, rituals, traditions, and beliefs inhabit particular landscapes? This seminar treats these questions by focusing on a particular landscape-the "desert," both imagined and real-as it has shaped religious ascetic practice. Biblical notions of howling desert wastelands and subsequent ideas about deserts inhabited by terrifying and grotesque demons; paradise, a garden where angels' wings whir and pure light shines; valleys of rattling dry bones, sinews, and skins that breathe with new life; heavens clanging with the sound of war between seven-headed dragons and angels; demons coming in the forms of roaring lions and hissing serpents-the religious imaginary is shaped in striking ways by sensory landscapes. We will read widely from desert Christian monastic literatures, mostly from late ancient Egypt, to explore both the historical development of monasticism in Christianity and examine why the monastic impulse seems so closely tied to the "desert." In addition to reading saints lives, we will read early monastic rules, the desert fathers, and we will draw from archaeological sources to examine the varieties of ascetic practices in the deserts of late ancient Egypt, Gaza, Sinai, Palestine, and Syria. Throughout the course we will explore ancient and modern ideas about "wilderness" and we will explore parallels between ancient Near Eastern literatures and their nineteenth- and twentieth-century parallels in the American frontier and environmental literatures.
MEDVL4680;;;Love and Sex in the Italian Renaissance;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;HIST4680;ITAL4680;;;An exploration of literary representations of love, sex, and eros in Renaissance Italy and attempts by secular governments and the Church to manage, discipline, and punish sexual transgression. Primary texts include Boccaccio's Decameron; selected fifteenth-century novelle; plays by Machiavelli (Mandragola, Clizia), Bibbiena (Calandria) and Pietro Aretino (The Master of the Horse); Giulia Bigolina's novel Urania; and Moderata Fonte's dialogue The Worth of Women.

MEDVL4910;;;Approaches to Medieval Violence;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;HIST4910;HIST6920;MEDVL6910;;;'Violence' has become an unavoidable - and urgently troubling - buzzword in contemporary Western culture. We worry about its manifestations and representations in our own civilization, we scan foreign societies with which we interact for any sign of it, we fantasize about consummating it or construct our utopias around its absence. This course is intended as an opportunity for students working on a variety of topics, periods and areas in premodern Europe to investigate its relevance to their own studies. Through an examination of readings on violence in particular historical contexts, from Late Antiquity to the Early Modern period, we will seek to elicit reflection on what is meant by the concept, to prompt consideration of distinctions among forms of violence, and to sample a variety of analytical approaches and tools.  Graduate Students should sign up for HIST 6920.

MUSIC3250;;;Music & Monarchy in the 18th Century: Paris, Berlin, & Vienna;;;3;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;;;;A musical enthusiast traveling in eighteenth-century Europe would have found that listening experiences varied a great deal depending on the city one visited. Eighteenth-century monarchs and their courts often acted as nuclei around which musical talent gathered, creating distinctive musical "scenes" in a variety of European cities. But how did the ideologies endorsed by both despots and "Enlightened" despots affect musical happenings in the cities in which they resided? And how did the consumption of certain types of music in certain spaces help delineate boundaries between social strata? This course explores the kinds of musical culture-courtly, sacred, public, and private-available to the listener in the communities surrounding Louis XIV and XV of France, Frederick II of Prussia, and Maria Theresa and Joseph II of Austria-Hungary. Our investigation into the ways in which power dynamics, royal patronage, and religious practices shaped drastically different musical scenes will allow us to explore music of the renowned "greats" (such as Rameau, C. P. E. Bach, and Mozart) as well as music by composers who achieved great success in their day, but who are now often left out of the historical narrative. We will likewise have the chance to explore alternate perspectives from which this music may be (and has been) approached, including those of the monarch him/herself, the contemporary music critic, the composer as royal employee or "freelancer," the musical historian, and of course, the modern-day listener.

NBA5000;;;Intermediate Accounting;;;3;;;Spring.;;;;;;Prerequisite: NCC 5000 or equivalent.;;;;;;This course is relevant to a general business career, but is particularly relevant to careers that involve the use of financial statements.  My objective is to enable you to become more knowledgeable, skeptical consumers of financial information by teaching you to (1) understand and be able to reconstruct the accounting that produced the numbers you see in financial statements and the financial press, and (2) anticipate circumstances where financial information is likely to be biased or imprecise, in part by understanding the alternatives that were available at the time that a choice among accounting treatments was made.  This objective will be achieved by a combination of lectures and analyzing and discussing articles from the financial press and cases that are based on actual financial statements.
NBA5010;;;Taxes and Business Strategy;;;1;;;Spring.;;;;;;Prerequisite: NCC 5000, NCC 5060.;;;;;;Part of being financially savvy is having an understanding of how taxation affects business decisions; e.g., forming a corporation and raising capital, operating the firm, distributing cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, expanding through acquisition, and divesting lines of business. Taxes have a direct impact on cash flow and often divert 30 to 40 percent of the firm's pretax cash flow to the government, effectively making the government the single largest stakeholder in many firms. Having an understanding of taxation and how firms plan accordingly is important for just about any career path students choose, whether they will be an investment banker, venture capitalist, consultant, money manager, CFO, treasurer, controller, taking over a family-owned business, or an entrepreneur setting up a new business. Topics include tax planning fundamentals, corporate tax fundamentals, taxation of mergers and acquisitions, taxation of divestitures, international taxation, taxes and wealth planning.

NBA5060;;;Financial Statement Analysis;;;1.5;;;Fall, spring.;;;;;;Prerequisite or corequisite: NCC 5060, NBA 5000, or permission of instructor.;;;LAW6060;LAW6060;LAW6060;;;This course develops a set of core skills essential to financial statement analysis. We will cover strategic ratio analysis, cash flow analysis, pro forma financial statements, financial modeling, and firm valuation using discounted cash flow and residual income techniques. Emphasis is on practical applications. The course format is a combination of case studies and lectures. The lectures communicate subtler aspects of the material while the cases provide hands-on experience.
NBA5061;;;Comprehensive Financial Statement Analysis;;;3;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;This course explores the practice of financial statement analysis. The course includes two parts. In the first part, students develop a set of core skills essential to financial statement analysis. We cover strategic ratio analysis, cash flow analysis, forecasting, proforma financial statements, and firm valuation using discounted cash flow and residual income techniques. The second part focuses on more advanced financial statement topics and specialized industries. We cover investment research, accounting analysis, credit analysis, banking, mergers and acquisitions, and issues relating to international financial statement analysis. The course emphasizes the practical application of the material using a combination of lecture, cases, and hands-on examples.  Students are evaluated based on a projects and exams.  The course presumes an understanding of basic corporate finance theory and basic financial accounting, but little or no previous experience in security valuation. The class is designed for students planning for careers in investment banking, corporate management, venture capital, security analysis, credit analysis, consulting, or public accounting.
NBA5070;;;Entrepreneurship for Scientists and Engineers;;;3;;;Fall, spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;Specifically designed for mentored independent study, this course is customized using streaming video, guest speakers, distance learning, and special lectures/tutorial sessions. Work is focused on a single project: students form a startup team and follow a technical business idea of their own choosing through the process of developing and founding a business that can attract venture investors. Learn how high-technology ideas are converted into world-class businesses in venture-backed startup companies as well as in new business development in existing companies. Tutorial sessions with professors apply lessons to the team business plan.
NBA5090;;;Advanced Financial Statement Analysis;;;1.5;;;Fall.;;;;;;Prerequisite: NBA 5060, finance immersion course, or permission of instructor.;;;LAW5090;LAW5090;LAW5090;;;This course builds on the material of NBA 5060 and focuses on more advanced financial statement topics and specialized industries.

NBA5100;;;Social Entrepreneurship;;;1;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;This is an introductory course to the field of social entrepreneurship. Using case studies, class discussion, and guest speakerships we explore the full range of business approaches to addressing important societal needs and develop a conceptual framework for understanding social enterprises.
NBA5110;;;Financial Modeling;;;1.5;;;Fall, spring.;;;;;;Prerequisite: mastery of basic Excel skills.;;;;;;Financial modeling is the art and science of constructing spreadsheet models of firms' future financial statements. This class draws on and integrates students' knowledge of concepts learned in prior accounting classes by modeling the effect on the income statement, balance sheet, and statement of cash flows of financial transactions such as leveraged buyouts, mergers and acquisitions, and corporate reorganizations. The class meets in the state-of-the-art Parker Center computer lab, and active student participation is emphasized.
NBA5130;;;International Finance Cases;;;1.5;;;Fall.;;;;;;Prerequisite: NCC 5060 or permission of instructor.;;;;;;International finance is different because of two issues: exchange-rate volatility and barriers to the flow of capital. Furthermore, political risk is heightened when money crosses borders, and governance, disclosure, law, and regulation are more varied than in a single-country context. The purpose of this course is to practice applying the ideas and methods of finance to cross-border problems. The course is centered on six cases including discussions of related research and other materials.
NBA5140;;;Ethics and Corporate Culture;;;1.5;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;In the high-pressure worlds of business and law, all too often good people do bad things.  In many cases, the unethical behavior is due in part to a toxic corporate culture. The attitudes, values, and practices that prevail in their organizations induce otherwise ethical employees to take actions that violate widely shared norms of conduct. Such behavior can be costly-even disastrous-leading to ruined careers, tarnished corporate reputations, and legal liability for the individuals and their companies. In an environment where "only results matter," it can be difficult for a new MBA or law school graduate to recognize the risks. If she does see the dangers, she may still find it hard to avoid them.  This course seeks to help MBAs and law students understand how a firm's culture, combined with common human tendencies, can tempt-or push-employees into unethical behavior. It also considers how employees can meet ethical challenges posed by their firms' cultures. Class sessions include discussion of case studies and readings reporting on relevant research in psychology and organizational behavior, as well as talks by noted guest speakers from the worlds of business, law, journalism, and academia. The grade in the course is based on class participation and on two written case analyses, including a final project.
NBA5150;;;Leadership Theory and Practice;;;3;;;Fall, spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;Focuses on the challenges of effective leadership in a complex world. The course has four significant parts: (1) Exploring historical and contemporary theories and models of leadership through the required text and selected articles; (2) Examining and applying the Johnson School's Leadership Model; (3) Analyzing the practical challenges of leadership through case studies, executive speakers, and company visits; (4) Developing self-awareness of the student's leadership strengths and weaknesses through the use of behavioral instruments and group exercises and creating a personal action plan for improvement. A critical element of this course is the coaching and feedback students receive on their own leadership styles and behaviors from their peers and instructor.
NBA5160;;;Business and Sustainability;;;1.5;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;With the changing dynamics of the growing global economy new business opportunities are being realized by addressing environmental and social issues. This course will help students understand how sustainability can be framed as a strategic opportunity for businesses and what today's companies are doing to realize revenue growth - as well as cost savings - from addressing social and environmental issues in the marketplace.
NBA5180;;;The Art of Innovation: A Design Thinking Immersion;;;1.5;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;This hands-on course will prepare you to be future innovators by teaching you the human-centered design methodology known as "Design Thinking" that was made famous by David Kelley, founder of IDEO, and the Stanford d.school. You will be part of a cross-disciplinary team where you will be immersed in the entire design thinking cycle: empathize, define, ideate, prototype and test. Students will work on a challenge provided by a real sponsor. Required: attendance at an all-day out of town trip on Saturday, Sept. 20.
NBA5200;;;Retail Operations;;;1.5;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;This course is designed as a half-semester elective course for MBA students. It will examine various new developments in retailing and the application of operations management principles to these developments. It is recommended for students interested in careers in (1) Retailing and supply chain management, (2) Businesses like banking, consulting, and information technology that provide services to retailers, and (3) Manufacturing companies that sell their products through retailers. Retailing is not only a link in the supply chain, but also an important industry for a number of reasons. This industry, more than any other, is at the forefront of business changes since it directly connects with the consumer and generates demand for the rest of the economy. It is an intensely dynamic industry, with continuous changes in marketing channels, technology, and sourcing. It has gone through remarkable developments through history, and has often been an incubator for new business concepts. Currently, retailing is leading economic growth and transformation in emerging markets around the world, both through global sourcing and global marketing. In the US, retailing comprises 40% of the economy, and is the largest employer. Problems faced by retailers are shared by other firms in the economy, and retailers are often the dominant player in a supply chain. Thus, retailing is also academically interesting as a laboratory to learn and test concepts that may apply to other businesses. Various types of sophisticated data can be collected in retailing easier than in other industries. Performance can be measured accurately and rapidly. Managers in retailing can also change their strategies and product mix in relatively short periods of time. Finally, low entry and exit barriers magnify risks and rewards in this industry, so that we find firms with stellar growth as well those with a history of bankruptcies. We shall study all these different aspects of retail operations through case discussions and lectures.
NBA5240;;;Macroeconomics and International Trade;;;3;;;Spring.;;;;;;Prerequisite: NCC 5020 or equivalent or permission of instructor.;;;;;;Applies basic macroeconomic theory to such problems as inflation, unemployment, economic growth, and productivity, and examines how those problems interact with international trade and finance. Students learn to be informed observers of national and international economic policies and discerning users of economic analyses and forecasts. Uses a lecture/discussion format.
NBA5270;;;Applied Economic Analysis;;;3;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;This course will emphasize how economic analysis can help firms and individuals make the most of their opportunities. Of special interest to managers, consultants, and policy makers will be the course's focus on examples that illustrate how faulty economic reasoning leads to inefficient outcomes. The course will also emphasize strategic thinking, and will instruct students in the art of "economic naturalism"-- the use of economic reasoning to understand and explain everyday patterns of individual and firm behavior.
NBA5360;;;Investment Banking Essentials;;;1.5;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;This course will help students learn how to be investment bankers.  Taught by an experienced ex-banker on the faculty of Johnson, this class  will introduce students to capital raising, LBO, and strategic M&amp;A  transactions in a hands-on way that will focus on how to perform IB  analyst-level duties. Students will be introduced to valuation (comps,  precedents, and DCF), accretion/dilution, and how to assemble a pitch  book. Working in groups, students will be presented with real-world  assignments and will present their work in class. No Prelim, No Final  exam.
NBA5370;;;Intensive Private Equity Practicum;;;3;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;
NBA5380;;;The Business Idea Factory;;;1.5;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;Do you want to become an entrepreneur, but you don't yet have that  brilliant idea?  This class will help you come up with new ideas and  evaluate which ones are the most worth pursuing to ensure you invest  your time and energies on ideas that have the most promise. The first  section of the course will be about places and processes that you can  use to find inspiration to come up with a large number of potential  business ideas. We will then walk through a systematic process to  evaluate, validate, and quantify the best ideas for each team.  This  process will be assisted by experienced entrepreneurs as guest speakers  who will share the inspirations for their businesses, the methods they  used to select those ideas as worthy of pursuit, as well as insights  into their careers.
NBA5390;;;Cornell Lectures in Finance;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NBA5410;;;Project Management;;;1.5;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;This course covers the basic concepts of project management.  It will  provide you an essential tool for introducing new products, programs,  and processes in an organization, on time and on budget.
NBA5420;;;Investment and Portfolio Management;;;3;;;Spring.;;;;;;Prerequisite: NCC 5060, NCC 5560, or an equivalent core finance course.;;;;;;This course emphasizes both conceptual foundations and practical implementation. The material in the course would be helpful to anyone interested in investing. However, the course should be especially useful to students interested in an investment management career (e.g., portfolio management in mutual funds and hedge funds, equity research, equity trading, risk management, investment consulting, and investment banking). The first part of the course is an extensive module on strategic asset allocation with a focus on practical implementation. The second part of the course deals with security selection, with a particular focus on screening and multi-factor models. The course highlights trends in the investment management industry and introduces terminology and tools familiar to investment professionals.
NBA5430;;;Financial Markets and Institutions;;;3;;;Fall, spring.;;;;;;Prerequisite: NCC 5060.;;;LAW6430;LAW6430;;;This course presents an overview of the structure and function of the financial markets. The course attempts to provide a general working knowledge of the financial system by examining not only how various intermediaries and markets work, but also their evolution over time.  The role of central banks, and their operations, is particularly emphasized, as is the nature of risk management both within the financial institution and more broadly for the financial system. Topics considered here include swaps, credit derivatives, value at risk models, and systemic risk. Just as intermediation has moved from institutions to markets, the course follows a similar evolution in the topics studied over the course of the semester. Market topics examined include securitization, the money markets, the Treasury market, and the financial crisis.
NBA5450;;;The Search for Alpha;;;1;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;This course will focus on the fundamental trends under way in the asset management industry. While it will start with an overview of the investment management industry, it will move quickly toward a review of the more recent growth in hedge funds. Given the attention that the investment management industry (not to mention the world at large) has put on hedge funds and the relatively unregulated and secretive nature of the breed, the course will seek to answer the question of what exactly is going on in the industry and where it is going. The intention will be to give students an overview of the hedge fund space from the perspective of what comprises it, who the participants are (managers, investors, support areas, and intermediaries), how hedge funds are assessed and measured both individually and in portfolio, how investors access hedge funds, and what major issues face the industry.
NBA5470;;;The Long and Short of Liability Driven Alpha;;;1;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;Combines a thorough review of the pension market (emphasizing Defined Benefit Plans, but covering Defined Contribution Plans as well) and the looming Global Pension Crisis as well as a review of the use of pension assets via securities lending and finance in the underpinning of the financial services industry via the all-important collateral management process.
NBA5510;;;Emerging Markets Finance;;;1.5;;;Spring.;;;;;;Prerequisite: NCC 5060 or permission of instructor.;;;;;;This course explores financial decision making that is special to emerging economies. These countries constitute the engine-of-growth opportunities in the world economy, but their markets are also prone to crises, a feature that reinforces the importance of measuring risk. Most of the decisions the course evaluates are corporate financial management decisions from the point of view of a multinational corporation that is targeting an investment in an emerging market or is based in an emerging market.
NBA5530;;;Accounting and Financial Decision Making;;;3;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;Focuses on basic financial and managerial accounting and the economic and financial concepts that have a bearing on managerial decisions. The goals are to (1) give students a working knowledge of the accounting process and the value and limitations of the data that come out of the accounting information system; (2) familiarize students with key concepts in managerial accounting and the application of cost information to pricing and operating decisions; and (3) promote an understanding of the use of economic theory in the evaluation of capital investment projects. The teaching methods consist of lectures and cases. Students are evaluated on the basis of exams.
NBA5540;;;International Finance;;;3;;;Fall.;;;;;;Prerequisite: NCC 5060 or permission of instructor.;;;;;;Applies principles of finance to the international setting. International finance is different in two basic respects: (1) the existence of multiple currencies adds risk to investment and financing decisions; (2) when corporations and portfolio investors cross international borders, both problems and opportunities arise. This course focuses on these issues and highlights how finance theory can be extended to address them. Students apply the basic principles of international finance to a variety of problems. The course helps students understand the ideas and research results of international finance and adapt what they learn to the practical problems in the increasingly globalized business world. The first part of the course outlines exchange rate volatility, barriers to international capital flows, and the value of international diversification. The second part presents a variety of problems, examples, and applications from the three basic themes described in part one. Spreadsheet assignments and a term project requiring data analysis develop research skills and illustrate academic concepts. Exams consist of computational, short answer, and short essay questions.
NBA5550;;;Fixed Income Securities and Interest Rate Options;;;3;;;Fall.;;;;;;Prerequisite: NCC 5060, NCC 5010.;;;;;;Designed to study the pricing, hedging, and risk management of fixed-income securities and interest rate derivatives. Topics include the term structure of interest rates, interest rate swaps (caps, floors, collars), the risk structure of interest rates, credit risk spreads, and corporate bond valuation. The method of instruction is lectures and discussion, and computer illustrations are an integral part of the course content. A secondary theme of the course is the use of models for risk management.
NBA5570;;;Case Studies in Venture and Private Equity Investments;;;1.5;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;Consists of a series of cases that focus on the private equity investments process and the subsequent management of such investments. The primary perspective is that of a private equity fund (early stage, growth or buyout) in assembling and evaluating information, preparing forecasts, assessing risks, developing and negotiating investment structure and terms, and deciding whether to invest. The secondary perspective is that of managing the private equity fund and the techniques and skills employed in growing value. Classroom discussions will be as if the class were an investment committee meeting. Grades are based on written investment memoranda prepared before class and quality of classroom participation.
NBA5580;;;Corporate Financial Policy;;;1.5;;;Spring.;;;;;;Prerequisite: NCC 5060.;;;;;;and liabilities, as well as their interaction with real-side decisions (investment, mergers, R&amp;D, employment, etc.). It takes the perspective of financial managers at public corporations, individuals that are responsible for financial decision-making, as well as that of market participants - e.g., investment bankers, analysts, fund managers - that monitor and evaluate corporate policies. Among other topics, the course will discuss issues related to corporate capital structure, dividend policy, issuance decisions, liquidity management, and risk hedging strategies. The course will do so going beyond standard textbook coverage, making sense of available research on financial policy, looking at what CFOs think via field surveys, studying real-world examples of financial policy-making. All of these elements are integrated and analyzed with rigorous methodology, but the point is to understand the economic objectives financial policies really mean to achieve.
NBA5590;;;The Venture Capital Industry and Private Equity Markets;;;0.5;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;Four lectures (two on Friday afternoon, two on Saturday morning) will be given by Jesse Reyes, a leading expert on private equity research who was the former head of research for Venture Economics, Thomson/Reuters private equity research and financial information subsidiary. The lectures will focus on the venture capital and private equity industries from the practitioners' perspective. Topics include (1) an introduction to the private equity market focusing on the transactions that define the industry, its structure, participants, history, and trends; (2) institutional private equity investing-examining how private equity investment fits into the institutional investors asset allocation mix; (3) an examination of private equity performance measurement and trends and how structural differences in private equity investments make optimized allocation decisions challenging; and (4) emerging issues facing the private equity industry such as new regulatory initiatives and fundraising and investment opportunity challenges. There will be a final paper.

NBA5650;;;Corporate Governance;;;1.5;;;Spring.;;;;;;Prerequisite: NCC 5060, NBA 6560, or permission of instructor.;;;;;;Deals with the ways in which different investors assure themselves of getting a return on their investments. How do investors get managers to return some of the profits to them? How do they make sure that managers do not invest their money in bad projects? These questions are extremely relevant for almost any organization, from startups to Forbes 500 companies. This course explores these issues through a series of case studies and examples. Topics depend on time availability. Career focus: M.B.A. Students aspiring to top corporate offices, regardless of functional area, or envisioning a career in M&amp;A/investment banking, financial management, or consulting firms.

Students receive feedback from classmates and the instructor, and have the opportunity to review their progress in individual tutorial sessions with professor.
NBA5690;;;Management Consulting Essentials;;;1.5;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;This course will help students learn about consulting and the skills and  capabilities to be a successful consultant.  The course will begin with  a module on successful case interviews.  The consulting process will be  discussed and why it leads to successful solutions for complex business  problems.  With the consulting process understood the course will focus  on develop a problem definition diagnostic framework, hypotheses,  analytical approaches, data collection and conclusions.  The course will  also include concepts critical to consulting including interviewing to  collect information, facilitating meetings, managing clients and their  expectations, selling recommendations and developing impactful  presentations.  The course will use a combination of lectures, case  work, individual and teamwork to learn the concepts.
NBA5710;;;Cornell Management Simulation;;;1.5;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;You've learned finance, marketing, operations, accounting, economics, management, leadership, statistics, and strategy. You've done a deep dive into at least one of these subject areas. But how do they fit together? How are they used to actually run a company? The Cornell Management Simulation elective course will give you the chance to form a team and run a company that will compete against your classmates in a simulated industry. At the beginning of the simulation, each team develops a strategy, and before the results of the last decision have been determined, presents an analysis of its performance, lessons learned, and its strategy for the future in a "board of directors" meeting. The first course meeting is 4 hours to introduce the simulation and its mechanics as well as a discussion of company strategy. Future meetings are weekly for 2 hours which includes time for teams to review their performance and work on their company decisions. Grades are based on the value created for the company's shareholders (relative to other firms in the same industry), the team's strategy, and the instructor's evaluation of team's performance at the board meeting. The course may be taken for a grade or pass/fail at the student's option.

Over the spring and summer largely fortune 500 companies are solicited for projects that students can work on during the fall semester, with three to five days during the semester of on-site interaction with client companies at their location or on campus. The projects are done by teams of students, typically four, supported by both the faculty and an experienced adviser. Lecture material covers the approach to structuring complex problems, conducting analytical work and developing conclusions and recommendations. Student teams are expected to communicate regularly with their clients and to have at least interim and final presentations. These experiential-learning projects will integrate the concepts and knowledge covered in the core courses and immersions as well as other fall electives. These client-critical projects typically incorporate the broad areas of strategy, operations, finance or marketing. Grading is a blend of client and faculty assessments.
NBA5760;;;International Consulting Practicum;;;3;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;The fall 2014 version of the International Consulting Practicum will be conducted jointly with the Indian Institute of  Management, Bangalore (IIMB).

Seven teams will consist of two students from Johnson and two from IIMB, and one team will be an all Cornell team.  Students will learn how to structure a consulting engagement and report on results, based on the Minto Pyramid Principle.  IIMB students will visit Ithaca and New York City during September 1-5.  During that week, there will be a number of mandatory lectures to be conducted outside of the regularly scheduled class time plus some optional company visits.  Johnson students will travel to Bangalore during the week of December 15 to visit companies in India.  The anticipated travel cost is $2,500-3,000 per student, with the possibility of a subsidy between $1,500- 2,000 depending on company sponsorship of the course.

The graded work is a written proposal for an M&amp;A transaction between two existing companies in different countries prepared by small teams. Proposals are based on publicly available financial, business, legal, and other documents and data and any other information obtained. The goal of the written work is to simulate the process in which business people, investment bankers, and lawyers work together to structure transactions across national borders. The reading covers the basic business and legal issues most frequently encountered in international mergers and acquisitions. Class discussion occasionally refers to the reading but generally covers other issues.
NBA5880;;;Critical Thinking for Business Leaders;;;1.5;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;This course is based on the proposition that leading well requires thinking well-that is, in order to succeed in any business leadership role, one must learn, exhibit, and model critical thinking skills to organizational stakeholders: colleagues, supervisors/senior executives, and clients/customers. The first few class sessions look at a series of brief articles that attempt to advance arguments in favor of a particular business proposition, and students learn how to examine these arguments critically, including by evaluating the strength and limitations of the evidence presented and by identifying and articulating the best counter-arguments to the positions offered. The remainder of the course is spent applying these critical thinking skills to a set of business cases, using a Strategic Thinking Problem-Solving framework. By the end of the course, the goal is for students to be able to approach business problems in a systematic and critically thoughtful way, and to produce and communicate a problem solution that is well reasoned, well received by ultimate decision makers, and likely to be implemented with success by a group/organization that a student is leading.
NBA5920;;;Experience in International Management;;;1.5;;;Fall, spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;Combines classroom sessions and international experience with an increased awareness of business environments outside the United States.

NBA5980;;;Behavioral Finance;;;1.5;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;Behavioral Finance is a theory on the irrationality of stock markets. Unlike traditional finance theories, behavioral finance argues that some financial market phenomena can plausibly be understood only under the assumption that some market participants are not fully rational. This course introduces the conceptual framework of behavioral finance and then applies the framework to issues in stock market investment. Topics include: (1) investor psychological bias and irrational trading behavior, and how to overcome our own biases in stock trading; (2) limits of arbitrage and the risk of leveraged convergence trading; (3) stock index market timing (and why market timing is far more important in emerging markets around the world than in the US); (4) typical behavioral finance approaches in constructing outperforming stock portfolios (including value, momentum, size, earnings quality, corporate governance, effects of short-sale constraint, and many other effects); (5) applying behavioral finance concepts to understanding China's stock market (as an example of emerging equity markets).
NBA6010;;;Electronic Commerce;;;3;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;Electronic commerce, the use of information technology in conducting economic transactions and managing businesses over computer networks, has captured public attention because of its wide-ranging implications for businesses, markets, public institutions, and the general public. Electronic commerce involves a wide variety of cooperating technologies (e.g., communications, networks, databases, expert systems, and multimedia) and affects a wide variety of managerial issues. It created a new emphasis on information technologies and systems in management; led to the development of new technologies and new combinations of existing technologies to support management; and occasionally radically altered business practices and the role of management. Students in this course learn to conduct economic transactions and manage businesses on the Internet. All major technical and managerial issues are covered through computer exercises on the Internet and case studies and examples of businesses on the Internet.
NBA6029;;;NYC Technology Trek;;;1;;;Fall, spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;The October TECH TREK will focus on creating an innovative culture.  We will visit Google, Next Jump and Facebook.

Presents advances in computer technology emphasizing the fundamentals behind the increases in processing power, video and computer graphics capabilities, and network transmission. The second half of the course covers the effect of these scientific advances on many discipline-specific areas including photography, the film industry, the entertainment and animation industry, television broadcasting, publishing, and the computer industry itself. Sessions are devoted to the social and legal issues arising from the rapid advances in electronic communication. In attempting to predict the disruptive changes of the future, it is best to understand the technologies themselves. The course is especially tailored to a business school and industrial concerns and has interactive live demonstrations at the state-of-the-art laboratory of the Program of Computer Graphics. No prior knowledge of computer science is required.
NBA6170;;;Emerging Technology Markets;;;1.5;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;An overview of how successful companies combine a deep understanding of unmet customer needs with a key emerging and enabling technology to create significant new market and shareholder value. A proactive and repeatable 10-step Market Development Planning process will be described with special emphasis on tools and techniques that link industry and competitor technology trends with unmet customer needs. This course will give prospective brand managers, product managers, business and engineering managers the conceptual and operating tools to proactively identify, and successfully bring from the R&amp;D lab to the marketplace, new differentiated value propositions.

NBA6200;;;Marketing Research;;;3;;;Spring.;;;;;;Prerequisite: NCC 5010, NCC 5030, or equivalent.;;;;;;Deals with marketing research as a critical support function in corporations. The broad objective is to provide a fundamental understanding of marketing research methods employed by better-managed firms or proposed by leading academicians. The course is aimed at the manager, the ultimate user of marketing information, who is responsible for the scope and direction of research activities involved in obtaining, analyzing, and interpreting results of research. Covers the use of secondary sources of marketing information as well as qualitative research for designing studies and collecting primary data. Students are exposed to up-to-date methods in research design, qualitative research, measurement, data collection, and analysis. The emphasis is more on evaluating research methods and on interpretation and use of results, and less on mathematical derivations. Students are also exposed to the practical side of marketing research through case studies, problem sets, and projects.
NBA6220;;;Marketing Strategy;;;3;;;Fall.;;;;;;Prerequisite: NCC 5030.;;;;;;The process of finding, capturing, and retaining customers is perhaps the single most important contributor to a business's success. Doing so requires not only great products, but an effective marketing strategy based on a keen understanding of how those products fit into customers' lives relative to competition. The four main modules of this course deal with the process of developing a firm's product strategy; building a viable competitive strategy; managing customer relationships; and effective allocation of marketing resources. The material will be covered via lectures, case presentations and discussions, and talks by guest speakers. 
NBA6230;;;Actualizing Your Startup - Part I;;;1.5;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;Actualizing Your Startup Parts 1 and 2 are performance learning courses,  based around student projects in the form of students and teams  starting their own companies. eLab's instructors serve as coaches,  guides, mentors, teachers, and assistants to the teams, and will  coordinate the involvement of a number of high-profile mentors from the  startup and venture capital community.  Students will enhance their business and entrepreneurship learning by  putting theoretical concepts into practice in starting and growing their  own companies in a team environment. We expect that students will take  this opportunity to "make it real" - eLab is not about starting  theoretical companies, or theoretically exploring potential business  ideas.  Rather, it is about starting real companies that have the  potential to grow and provide employment and economic benefit to their  founders, and to provide deep experiential learning in starting and  growing a business.
NBA6250;;;International Marketing;;;1.5;;;Fall.;;;;;;Recommended prerequisite: background in core marketing.;;;;;;The course covers critical decisions in international marketing, and information need to make sound expansion decisions.

Students will enhance their business and entrepreneurship learning by putting theoretical concepts into practice in starting and growing their own companies in a team environment. We expect that students will take this opportunity to "make it real" - eLab is not about starting theoretical companies, or theoretically exploring potential business ideas. Rather, it is about starting real companies that have the potential to grow and provide employment and economic benefit to their founders, and to provide deep experiential learning in starting and growing a business.
NBA6340;;;Customer Relationship Management;;;3;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;The course is aimed at managers who are interested in pursuing activities in CRM built around the notion of customer centricity. The principal objectives of the course are to emphasize how CRM can help accomplish strategic initiatives and improve firm profitability, to develop essential skills using the statistics program, and to implement strategic initiatives in CRM. Students will be exposed to the practical side of CRM through case studies and hands-on exercises.
NBA6380;;;Finance & Sustainable Global Enterprise Colloquium;;;1;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;Finance + Sustainable Global Enterprise Colloquium is meant to provide students the opportunity to hear in-depth presentations in interactive sessions with leaders from the private, public, or non-profit sectors who are on the cutting edge of the finance-sustainability domain. The class will leverage connections from the Center for Sustainable Global Enterprise and faculty active in the finance industry. Session structures will vary in format and are likely to include lectures, living case studies, panel discussions, and moderated Q&amp;A. The instructor will strive for representation of a variety of areas, including public and private equity, investment banking, and managerial finance. Content will span environmental finance, impact investing, socially responsible investing, capital budgeting, project financing, and other areas relevant to the sustainable global enterprise space. The course will be open to any interested student, but students selected for the Center's Environmental Finance &amp; Impact Investing (EFII) Fellows Program will be required to enroll in the course. In addition to speaker sessions, there will be 1-3 additional sessions focused on synthesizing.
NBA6390;;;Data Driven Marketing;;;1.5;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;Deals with the use of data to make marketing decisions. Introduces concepts, methods, and applications of decision modeling to address marketing issues such as segmentation,targeting, positioning, promotions, advertising, and sales-force decisions. Unlike marketing courses that focus on conceptual material, this course provides skills to translate conceptual understanding into specific operational plans-a skill in increasing demand in organizations today. The course is particularly valuable to students planning careers in management consulting, marketing, and market research. It is designed for studentswho have some background in quantitative methods and have a willingness to deal with mathematical concepts.
NBA6410;;;Supply Chain Management;;;1.5;;;Spring.;;;;;;Prerequisite: NCC 5080 or permission of instructor.;;;;;;The supply chain costs in the U.S. economy exceed a trillion dollars per year. To manage supply chains effectively, one needs to develop the right product, coordinate information and material flows throughout the entire network and deliver the product at the right time at the right location. Since different supply chain partners may face different types of challenges and may have different objectives, it is difficult to coordinate information and material flows and even more difficult to entice these partners to collaborate. The goal of this course is to develop a better understanding of the challenges in managing supply chains. This course will be relevant for students considering careers in management consulting, general management and supply chain management.
NBA6430;;;Managerial Spreadsheet Modeling;;;1.5;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;The goal of this hands-on, lab-style course, taught in the Parker Center, is to develop proficiency in quantitative modeling within the environment of Microsoft Excel. Students develop and use spreadsheets to analyze a variety of business problems. The course has two principal components: spreadsheets and models. Spreadsheet topics include principles of good spreadsheet design, the effective presentation of information through spreadsheets (including graphical controls like sliding bars), and advanced Excel features (e.g., data validation, conditional formatting, scenarios). Modeling topics include the art of finding the appropriate level of modeling detail, practice in dealing with vague and unstructured problems, sensitivity analysis, and working with incomplete and unreliable data.
NBA6440;;;Competition from Emerging Markets: The New Emerging Multinationals;;;1.5;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;Over the last decade, emerging multinationals have expanded aggressively on a global scale. How these new comers have been able to succeed internationally? How are they changing the competitive environment for multinationals from the western world? What can we expect from them over the next years? These are some of the questions that will be addressed in this course. This course is aimed to students who wish to learn more about emerging multinationals and develop their knowledge of the characteristics of doing business in emerging markets. The overall goal is to understand all this within the framework of the general shift to a multipolar world.
NBA6450;;;Advanced Investment Strategies;;;1.5;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;This course introduces students to a variety of advanced investment strategies on modern financial markets. The quantitative trading strategies are based on time-series and cross-sectional return predictability on global financial assets such as equity indices, foreign currencies, commodities, and sovereign bonds. In particular, we study the fundamentals of commodity futures returns and momentum strategy on commodity investment, the carry trade and momentum strategy on currency investment, the volatility strategy on option investment. In addition to delivering trading strategies, we pay close attention to common risk factors behind these investment strategies. Special topics change from one year to another to reflect recent trends and practices in industry, and also the state-of-art research in academia. This year's special topics are stock crash concerns and expected returns, rare disaster concerns and hedge fund performance, and global tail risks across different asset classes.
NBA6460;;;Financial Institutions;;;3;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;LAW6461;;;An introduction to the regulatory structures, as well as some of the economic, technological and other factors, that pattern the conduct of financial intermediation in the U.S. The principal focus will be upon commercial banks, investment companies (mainly mutual funds), insurance companies, pension funds and securities firms in so far as these institutions discharge a common set of economic functions and give rise to a common cluster of counterparty and third party ("systemic") risks. Legal topics to be covered accordingly include entry-, functional and geographical restrictions; consumer-protection (including disclosure requirements) and competition-promotion; capital adequacy-, solvency- and related forms of risk-regulation (including deposit insurance); community-reinvestment; and "self-regulation." We shall also devote some attention to "alternative" financial service providers such as check-cashing services, community development financial institutions and micro-credit providers; and we shall take occasional note both of divergent (generally, non-American) jurisdictions' dominant modes of financial intermediation and of the "globalization" of finance, in order both to place what is distinctive about the dominant American forms into bolder relief and better to understand the forces operating behind recent and still unfolding changes to the American (and global) financial and finance-regulatory environments. No prior background in financial law or economics is required, but it is helpful.
NBA6490;;;Creating Project Driven Alpha;;;1;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;Creating Project Driven Alpha is a course on the project financing of a live real estate/entrpreneurial business venture. Lecture 1: From Project Vision to Early Stage Financing. Lecture 2: The ULURP Approval Process. Lecture 3: The Financing and Capital Stack. Lecture 4: Project Financing Alternatives - Traditional Capital Stacks and Creative Financings. Lecture 5: The Business Model: The Design and Construction Home Stretch, Operations and Marketing.
NBA6520;;;Commercializing University Technology;;;2;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;How do scientists take their research to the marketplace? How do scientists and entrepreneurs find and create market opportunities? Commercializing University Science and High Technology will tackle these issues and apply our learning to projects drawn from Cornell labs and local high-tech firms. This course is designed to help students identify, evaluate, and obtain control over technology opportunities. The course focuses on three themes: (1) the source, discovery, and evaluation of technological opportunities on a university campus; (2) increasing the efficiency of the innovation process to produce new technologies that satisfy customer needs; and (3) the different mechanisms available to appropriate returns from technology. The course uses readings, cases, and discussions with practitioners to examine this phenomenon. After completing this class, students will be familiar with basic principles related to technology entrepreneurship and will have gained a deeper understanding of the technology commercialization process at Cornell. The class will be composed of a select group of graduate students drawn from science, engineering, law, medicine, and the Johnson Graduate School of Business (enrollment is limited).
NBA6530;;;Strategic Alliances;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NBA6540;;;Power and Politics in Organizations;;;1.5;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NBA6560;;;Valuation Principles;;;1.5;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;This course is about valuation-the valuation of stocks, companies, parts of companies, and real assets. Three methods of valuation are introduced: intrinsic valuation, relative valuation by multiples using comparables, and contingent claims valuation, based on a real options approach. The rest of the course will be dedicated to understanding each of these methods in greater detail and more importantly, applying them to the valuation of actual companies. This will involve understanding in detail discounted cash-flow models and the many inputs required to build them; dividend discount models; the determination and use of relative-value multiples such as price/earnings and price/book value; and finally, how to apply option theory to specific problems in valuation. The course includes a special session on valuation approaches and challenges specific to venture capital and private-equity investing. This will include a discussion of topics such as required internal rates of return (IRRs), the effects of leverage on valuation, and issues relating to the valuation of high-growth startups.
NBA6590;;;Management of Financial Institutions;;;1.5;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;This half semester course examines contemporary management issues facing management of financial institutions such as banks, insurance companies, investment managers, etc. Through lectures, case studies and guest presenters, current issues in consumer financial services, corporate financial services, risk management in financial institutions, M&amp;A in financial institutions, etc. are addressed from a business manager, CEO and consultant/adviser perspective.
NBA6600;;;Corporate Social Responsibility;;;1.5;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;Most large companies and many medium-sized firms regularly undertake projects intended to help address urgent social and environmental concerns. These initiatives, commonly viewed as efforts in "corporate social responsibility" (CSR), stem from the growing conviction-among senior executives as well as other stakeholders-that business must be "part of the solution" of problems that threaten communities and even the planet itself. At the same time, corporations are not charities, and corporate managers must strive (within legal and ethical constraints) to serve the interests of shareholders. Consequently, firms that engage in CSR must find ways to meet social needs and protect the natural environment that are in line with the companies' strategic goals. Drawing from the recent literature on CSR, this course uses articles and book excerpts to acquaint students with current ideas and best practices in the field. The readings are generally supplemented by at least one guest speaker from a leading corporate practitioner of CSR. Class discussion of case studies gives students the chance to analyze CSR challenges confronted by specific companies and to identify and critically evaluate possible responses to those challenges. A final project, assigned to two-person teams, entails students' developing recommendations-supported by detailed analysis-for a particular company in its pursuit of "strategic CSR."
NBA6610;;;Nonprofit Governance and Leadership;;;1.5;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NBA6620;;;Product Marketing Insights;;;3;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;This course is for students in the MBA and AMBA programs. In the past, some students from the Engineering, Hotel, AEM (Dyson) and ILR programs have also attended this course. Impactful business leaders appreciate the importance of consumer insights. Many strategic decisions - such as introducing a new product, repositioning an existing product, or deciding whether to extend an existing brand or to introduce a new brand - are pivoted on consumer insights. In this course I will discuss how managers can uncover behavioral insights and use those insights to shape product marketing strategy. The course will cover the following four topics: CONSUMER INSIGHTS (What is consumer insight? What research methods can be used to uncover consumer insights?), POSITIONING &amp; BRANDING (Can you do the financial analysis required for a marketing plan? Why is positioning so important? Which segment should you target? Can intangible brand associations influence market shares? Should you extend your brand?  How is brand value measured?), INNOVATION (Do you have to be a pioneer to successfully innovate? How can new product diffusion be modeled? Is your category lifecycle slow-and-long or fast-and-short? How to test a concept? How can you optimize the attributes of your new concept? How can you forecast the sales of the new product?), PRICING &amp; ADVERTISING (Will a higher price help or hurt your brand? Does share-of-voice predict market share?). Please note that there is a significant overlap between the material taught in this course and the Strategic Brand Management course (NBA 6240) taught by me in the Strategic Marketing Immersion program. Therefore students, who have already attended the Strategic Marketing Immersion course will not be allowed to enroll for this course.
NBA6630;;;Managerial Decision Making;;;3;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;This course attempts to make its participants better managerial decision makers. However, most students find that the course applies equally well to their personal decisions. There are two other objectives. The first is to convey an enduring understanding of decision concepts, skills, and tools that, taken as a whole, comprise a troubleshooter's guide to dealing with the uncertainty, complexity, and conflict of the professional world. The second is to provide a framework for a good decision process in which all of the decision concepts, skills, and tools fit coherently. The pedagogical approach uses lectures, in-class exercises, and applications.
NBA6650;;;The Strategic Management of Technology and Innovation;;;3;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;This is an introductory management course covering the strategic management of technology and innovation in established firms as well as startup organizations. This course is designed for students who may someday work in, consult for, and/or create firms whose primary product is fundamentally related to technology or innovation. The course typically includes both M.B.A. students and graduate students in science. It starts by examining how industries are transformed by new technologies and how these patterns of industrial change generate both opportunity and high rates of firm failure. We will then explore the questions: Why do some technology leaders fail? and How do technology innovators successfully take on and replace incumbent firms? This leads to an examination of internal management issues, focusing on the design of innovative organizations: designing reward systems, managing growth, overcoming resistance to change, and using organizational culture to promote innovation.
NBA6660;;;Negotiations;;;1.5;;;Fall, spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;Judgment is the art and science of transforming perception into thought or opinion. Negotiation is the art and science of securing agreements between two or more interdependent parties. The purpose of this course is to understand the theory and processes of negotiation as it is practiced in a variety of settings. It is designed to complement the technical and diagnostic skills learned in other courses. A basic premise is that while a manager needs analytical skills to develop optimal solutions to problems, he or she also needs a broad array of negotiation skills for these solutions to be accepted and implemented. The course highlights the components of an effective negotiation and teaches students to analyze their own behavior in negotiations. It is largely experiential, giving students an opportunity to develop their skills by participating in negotiations and integrating their experiences with the principles presented in the assigned readings and course discussions.
NBA6700;;;Becoming a Leader;;;1.5;;;Fall, spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;This course explores the complex process of "becoming a leader" by systematically uncovering beliefs and myths about leadership and rigorously examining how they hold up to the scrutiny of critical thinking, analysis, and research. Each class will address a number of important questions about leadership. Generally, the class uses case studies and videos to first illustrate a topic by focusing on a specific leader and decision or dilemma faced by that leader, then abstract from the specific to the general by discussing the principles and research findings pertaining to that aspect of leadership. Students should also develop a significantly enhanced understanding of their own leadership strengths and objectives because the course requires personalization of concepts via a number of self-reflections and exercises.
NBA6710;;;Business Ethics;;;1.5;;;Fall, spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;Poor moral judgment can ruin a manager's career or even sink a company. In general, an organization cannot survive without the trust of numerous stakeholders, and ethical lapses destroy trust and threaten vital stakeholder relationships. In today's volatile and fiercely competitive business environment, a manager must be able to identify and effectively resolve ethical issues that inevitably arise in the pursuit of business (and career) objectives. This course is designed to enhance students' skills in moral reasoning as it applies to managerial decision making. It begins by examining normative concepts and principles that typically enter into moral reasoning, then uses those concepts and principles to analyze cases. Discussions are designed to help students understand the moral issues confronting the decision makers in the cases and explore how those issues might be addressed in ethically responsible ways.
NBA6730;;;Derivatives Securities Part I;;;1.5;;;Fall, spring.;;;;;;Prerequisite: NCC 5060 or permission of instructor.;;;;;;Derivative securities allow investors to shift risks that they would otherwise be forced to bear. This course provides an introduction to basic derivatives such as futures, swaps, and options. We deal with the issue of pricing derivative securities by simple arbitrage arguments, and develop a framework for analyzing and using financial derivatives in various applications. By the end of the course, you should have a good understanding of commonly used derivatives in practice. Although the study of financial instruments is inherently quantitative, we focus on economic intuitions and interpretations behind derivative securities while keeping mathematic derivations minimal.
NBA6740;;;Derivatives Securities Part II;;;1.5;;;Fall.;;;;;;Prerequisite: NCC 5060 or permission of instructor.;;;;;;This course is a continuation of NBA 6730 (Derivatives Securities I). First, we will further dig into options by discussing no-arbitrage bounds in option prices, American options, option trading strategies, implied volatilities, dynamic replications, and risk management through options. Second, we will explore corporate securities such as common equity, warrants, callable bond, puttable bond, and convertible bond. Finally, we will discuss credit risk and credit derivatives such as credit default swaps (CDS). We use real-world cases to illustrate important applications of derivatives. At the end of the course, you should have a good understanding of risk-neutral pricing that is fundamental to all derivative securities.
NBA6780;;;Advanced Private Equity: Negotiations and Structuring;;;2;;;;;;;;;Prerequisite: NBA 5640, NBA 3000, or permission of instructor.;;;;;;This course  focuses on hand-on aspects of private equity deals. Topics covered include: Private equity funds and their formation, industries and business models, investment and exit types, management, good investment selection, due diligence, governance and best practices, contracts, tax and legal  issues, and going private. There will be a final project.
NBA6790;;;Green Revolving Fund;;;3;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NBA6820;;;Negotiation 1: Negotiation Essentials;;;1.5;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;NBA 6830 requires that you take NBA 6820 as a prerequisite. Negotiation is the art and science of securing agreements between two or more interdependent parties. The purpose of this course is to understand the theory and processes of negotiation as it is practiced in a variety of settings. This course is designed to complement the technical and diagnostic skills learned in other courses at the Johnson School. A basic premise of the course is that while a manager needs analytical skills to develop optimal solutions, a broad array of negotiation skills is needed in order for these solutions to be accepted and implemented. The course is designed to help students approach negotiations with confidence. They have the opportunity to develop their negotiating skills experientially and to gain insight into what works, what does not, and why.
NBA6830;;;Negotiation 2: Advanced Negotiation for Global Leaders;;;1.5;;;Spring.;;;;;;Prerequisite: NBA 6820.;;;;;;The purpose of this course is to further the skills and knowledge you have acquired from Negotiation 1: Negotiation Essentials. The course is designed to provide an understanding and appreciation of complex and dynamic negotiations in today's globally diverse business environment. In particular, you will be introduced to theories and processes of negotiation between people with very different assumptions and mindsets, such as negotiation between heads of offices in different national locations in the same organization, business executives working with their legal counsels to get a deal done, or managers working with their cross-border alliance partners. The course is designed to enhance the awareness of your assumptions and beliefs, and their impact on your dealing with different others. In addition, the course is designed to help students approach complex and often emotionally charged negotiations with confidence and resilience. Students will have the opportunity to develop skills and mindsets important to such negotiations experientially and gain insight into what works, what does not, and why.
NBA6860;;;Startup Learning Series;;;1;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;An introduction of core concepts encountered in entrepreneurial businesses. The class is designed to broadly prepare students for working in start-up entrepreneurial environments and assist in fostering a like mindset. The course consists of lectures, guest speakers and a short written paper. By the end of the course, students will be able to discuss topics and issues related to beginning and running start-up companies. Participants will understand terminology and general concept categories including idea validation and market assessment, product and marketing strategy, networking, team selection culture and team building, legalities formation issues, business partnerships, marketing tactics, patents trademarks copyrights and financing business.
NBA6930;;;Strategy and Tactics of Pricing;;;3;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;This course develops a structured framework for assessing and formulating pricing strategies based on an understanding of economic, psychological, legal, and organizational factors involved in making the profitable pricing decisions by a firm. Students will learn state-of-the-art frameworks and will master the essential pricing techniques, and acquire important pricing decision making skills.
NBA6950;;;Game Theory and Business Strategy;;;1.5;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;Game theory is the science of strategic decision making in situations where players' actions are interdependent. It provides a method for identifying optimal strategies and predicting the outcomes of strategic interactions. Using lectures, in-class games, and assignments, this course develops the basic tools of game theory as they relate to business situations, and then applies them real-world cases. Topics include strategic cooperation and punishment between firms, strategic commitments, predatory and limit pricing, entry deterrence, and auctions. The final deliverable is a take-home essay in which you apply the course material to a game theoretic setting of your choice. This course requires only basic mathematics skills, but a familiarity with microeconomics and strategy is recommended.
NBA6960;;;Emerging Growth Companies and Venture Capital Financing: Principles and Practice;;;3;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;LAW6335;;;The start-up high technology enterprise, privately financed largely with funds provided by angel investors and venture capital firms, is a successful source of important new and technologically innovative products.  Many highly visible and successful companies have raised venture capital at some point in their life cycle.  This course covers the legal and business issues that arise in the context of representing emerging growth companies and the venture capital investors who provide an important source of capital to such companies. In particular, the course will focus on the legal issues typically encountered by private companies at formation, financing, operation and key corporate events, including acquisition transactions and public offerings. Topics covered will include corporate formation and governance, angel investments (both equity and debt), venture capital financing, employment and equity compensation matters, protection of intellectual property, securities laws compliance, venture debt financing and exit strategies through merger, acquisition or initial public offering. The course will offer an introduction to these topics through the eyes of attorneys who practice in a leading Silicon Valley-based law firm active in New York City's technology market and may also include guest presentations by industry participants, such as venture capitalists, angel investors and entrepreneurs.
NBA6970;;;Private Equity Playbook;;;3;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;LAW6298;;;This course will examine the private equity industry by exploring the many roles that lawyers can play in advising private equity firms and their investors. It will highlight the ways in which lawyers can best advise private equity clients by understanding their client's business objectives and by developing the judgment necessary to be effective counselors. The course will focus on private equity acquisitions (including public and private transactions), as well as on the evolving fundraising market and the investor community, financing private equity transactions, exit transactions (such as IPOs, strategic and secondary sales), governance issues in private equity portfolio companies, regulatory and litigation issues facing private equity firms, the role of management in private equity transactions, and the issues that arise when private equity portfolio companies become troubled.

NES2575;;;Myth and Religion in Mesopotamia;;;3;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;JWST2575;NES6575;RELST2575;;;This course will survey the cultic practices and beliefs of ancient Babylonia and Assyria, the two major civilizations of Mesopotamia.

We will also examine the performance of magical rituals and incantations, methods of predicting the future, and the role of sacred marriage, prostitution, and slavery in the ancient temple.
NES2615;;;Archaeology of Empires;;;3;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;ANTHR2015;ARKEO2015;;;The word "empire" today evokes modern, capitalist, European, even American experiments in expansion and domination. But empires have been part of the political repertoire for millennia, which means some very old technologies of power, violence, colonialism, as well as multiculturalism and tolerance have endured, in more or less direct ways, into our contemporary world. In this course, we comparatively examine a wide range of early empires-Roman and Persian, Aztec and Inka, Assyrian and Spanish-with an eye to understanding archaeology's unique contribution to the study of imperialisms past and present. That contribution, we shall discover, centers on the relationship between imperial power and the vast material world of things.

The course will conclude with some brief reflections on historical memory and the modern and contemporary significance of the two religious communities' interactions during the classical age of Islam.
NES2644;;;Introduction to Judaism;;;3;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;JWST2644;RELST2644;;;In this course, students will survey the development of Judaism from its roots in ancient Mesopotamia to modernity. Rather than thinking of Judaism as static and easily definable, we will explore a history that is complex and dynamic. Over the three thousand year period that we will be studying, individuals and groups who identified themselves as Israelites or Jews developed a remarkable variety of beliefs and practices in conversation and in competition with other groups, including Christianity and Islam. We will examine trends and key moments of this process in order to understand how continuity and change, the construction of identity, and the competition for legitimacy have shaped our contemporary ideas about what Judaism is. We will approach this subject from a historical perspective, analyzing material evidence and reading texts from each period in translation, and from a religious studies perspective, carefully observing how the meaning of categories such as religion and Judaism change over time. A better understanding of these changes can help us better to appreciate difference and conflict both ancient and contemporary.

Readings will be supplemented with translated primary sources, which will form the backbone of class discussions.
NES2687;;;Environmental Issues in the Contemporary Middle East;;;3;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;BSOC2681;GOVT2583;JWST2687;;;Centrally located between two continents; the Middle East is drawn by nature to many environmental challenges that are re-lated to its unequal distribution of natural resources associated with its geological setting, mosaic ethnic composition, and cultural diversity. Such environmental background sets the need for an essential understanding of challenges that faces the area and is likely fundamental to its survival. In this course, we will assess environmental issues facing the current Middle East including but not limited to i. population exponential growth, ii. water scarcity, iii. natural resources distribution, iv. en-vironmental hazards associated with conflict, and v. tourism to provide future recommendations for environmental man-agement that focuses mainly on youth involvement i.e. the concerned generation.

Throughout the course, we will supplement our reading of primary texts with art, archaeology, music, and manuscripts.
NES2724;;;Introduction to the Hebrew Bible;;;3;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;JWST2724;RELST2724;;;The Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) is a repository of ancient Israelite religious, political, social, historical, and literary traditions. For the modern reader these ancient traditions are often obscured by a focus on the text as revelation. The purpose of this course is to introduce students to the biblical world by reading the Hebrew Bible in translation, on its own terms, as a body of literature that evolved in an ancient Near Eastern context. The Bible itself will be the primary text for the course, but students will also be exposed to the rich and diverse textual traditions of the ancient Near East, including Mesopotamia, Egypt, Moab, and Ugarit. In addition, this course will explore the impact of early biblical interpretation on shaping the monotheistic traditions inherited in the West. As participants in a secular course on the Bible, students will be challenged to question certain cultural assumptions about the composition and authorship of the Bible, and will be expected to differentiate between a text's content and its presumed meaning.
NES2777;;;Introduction to Rabbinic Literature and History;;;3;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;CLASS2631;JWST2777;RELST2777;;;This course offers an overview of Rabbinic Literature from the first century BCE through the eight century of the Common Era. Each class will combine broad historical background with the close reading of Rabbinic texts. We will not only try to understand what these texts say and how they say it but we will also explore how Rabbinic ideas and modes of expression compare to those with which we as modern readers are more familiar. We will begin with a survey of various forms of Bibli-cal and post-Biblical Second Temple writings. These texts will serve to establish the literary frameworks against which the rabbinic genres form. We will then explore the Mishanh, the Tosefta, and the Palestinian and Babylonian Talmuds. Through an exploration of the development of parallel themes, we will come to an understanding of how and when these texts evolved. Finally, we will explore a number of Midrashic compilations and assess their historical settings as well as their literary and ideological relationships to the two Talmuds. All Texts will be read in translation.

NES3519;;;State and Society in Modern Iran (Through Literature and Film);;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;;;;In the conditions of strict censorship and numerous limitations on various forms of political organization and activism, literature and cinema, especially Iran's internationally acclaimed art cinematography, have been the major outlets through which the social and political concerns of the Iranian society have been voiced throughout the modern period. The course explores major themes and periods in Iran's transition from the secular state of the Pahlavi dynasty to the religious state of the Islamic Republic in the 20th and 21st centuries. We will focus on social as well as political themes including the Anglo-Russo-American Occupation of Iran, the 1979 Islamic Revolution, U.S.-Iranian relations, Iraq-Iran War, the Green Movement and the crisis of Islamic government, Images of the West in Iran, Modern Youth Culture, Gender segregation, and the struggle between modernity and traditionalism in contemporary Iran. We will watch selected Iranian documentary and feature films and draw on modern Persian literature but will approach them not as art forms but as reflections of major socio-economic, political, and religious phenomena in Iran's modern history. We will read and watch what the Iranians wrote and produced, read and watched, in order to view and explain Iran and its relations with the West through the Iranian eyes. We will examine how the Iranians perceived themselves and the others, how they viewed their own governments and the West, what issues inspired and shaped their outlook outside the official censorship during the period in question. All readings are in English translation and the films are with English subtitles. The course includes lectures deconstructing political, religious, and social evolution of modern Iran as well as regular class discussions where we will address the issues in question from a variety of perspectives.
NES3637;;;History and Literature of Early Christianity;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;CLASS3637;JWST3637;MEDVL3637;NES6637;RELST3637;;;This course traces the historical development of Christianity from its roots in 1st century Palestinian Judaism to the emergence of Islam in the early 7th century, with special emphasis on the period prior to the "conversion" of Constantine in the 4rth century. The focus will be on exploring the rich diversity of Christianity in late antiquity by reading a wide range of primary literary sources, including selections from the New Testament, church fathers, apocryphal writings, gnostic literatures, saints lives, and much more. In addition, we will study the material culture of early Christianity through archaeology, art, inscriptions, and papyri. Special attention will be given to the varieties of Christianity and the ways in which various forms of Christianity in different regions around the Mediterranean interfaced with paganism, Judaism, and Islam.
NES3655;;;Minorities of the Middle East;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;JWST3655;;;In the media we read about conflict in Iraq between Sunnis, Shiites, and Kurds; strife between Muslims and Copts in Egypt; rebellion in Syria against the ruling Alawite minority; and violence between Israelis and Palestinians; and the list goes on. This course aims to enrich students' understanding of the diversity of Middle Eastern countries, exploring histories of inter-communal contact and conflict. In commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of World War I, we will begin our exploration by reflecting on the legacy of the Ottoman Empire and the impact of its dissolution. We will focus our attention on commercial centers that fostered inter-communal relations, as well as investigating sites of strife and cases of minority repression. We will read histories, memoirs, and fiction, and view films that help us better understand inter-communal relations, tensions, and conflict. We will also interrogate the terms for exploring a range distinctions among majority and minority populations including: religious difference (Muslims, Christians, and Jews); divisions of religious rite (Sunni and Shiite); entho-linguistic minorities (Armenians and Kurds); national identities (Israelis and Palestinians); cultures of origin (Mizrahi, Sephardi, and Ashkenazi Jews).

Each week will feature grammar lessons and a reading of an important Sumerian historical or literary work in English translation. Through lecture and discussion, the class will explore the deep roots of the Sumerian historical memory, the origins of Mesopotamian civilization, and the role of the central government in the development of writing.
NES3700;;;Arabic Language Through Film;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;Prerequisite: NES 1203  or permission from instructor.;;;;;;The objective of this course is to help students develop all four communicative skills (listening, speaking, reading and writing) through the use of Arabic films coupled with other structured materials such as study guides, short readings and other authentic resources. Each lesson focuses on student-centered and interactive activities that include pair or group work, role-play, debates, and class presentations.
NES3723;;;The Arabian Nights: Then and Now;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;COML3723;COML6723;NES6723;;;The medieval Arabic cycle of stories known as The Arabian Nights or The Thousand and One Nights is a classic of world literature. In the first part of the course we will read the Nights and discuss both its dominant themes-deceit, love, sex, revenge, violence, and justice-and its storytelling contexts and antecedents (e.g. the Sanskrit Jataka Tales and the Middle Persian Tales of Bidpai). And in the second part, we will explore the ways in which the Nights' themes and tales have been adapted and appropriated by authors such as Jan Potocki in Polish, Edgar Allan Poe, John Barth and Mary Zimmerman in English, Jorge Luis Borges in Spanish, and Naguib Mahfouz in Arabic itself; and by filmmakers such as Korda, Pasolini and Barron. All material is in English translation.
NES3740;;;Medieval Travel and Exploration;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;COML3724;JWST3740;MEDVL3740;;;In the Middle Ages, people traveled for all many reasons: for adventure, for commerce, on pilgrimage, for conquest.  We will read the accounts of medieval travelers in order better to understand the motives and motivations for travel and for exploration.  Our travelers will include Christian, Jewish, and Muslim merchants, ambassadors, scholars, geographers, explorers, sailors and soldiers.  Readings will include Margery Kempe, Marco Polo, Ibn Battutah, Usama ibn Munqidh, and Benjamin of Tudela.  All material in English translation.

NES3864;;;National Security in the Middle East;;;4;;;;;;;;;;;;GOVT3264;;;National security in general and the security sector (the military and the other security services) in particular, are critical factors when attempting to comprehend both recent and past developments in the Middle East, including, most recently, the events of the "Arab Spring" and its aftermath. In this course, we will discuss the different political, economic, social and cultural roles played by the military and the security sector, but also by more informal "security networks," and, occasionally, by violent sub-state non-state actors (VISNAS) and violent trans-national non-state actors (VITNAS), in the Middle East as a subcategory of the non-Western regions. In the first part of the course, we will discuss some of the main areas where the impact of the security sector, of informal "security networks," and of VISNAS and/or VITNAS can be discerned: the process of state formation and its various facets; the relationship between the civilian and security spheres; and inter-communal relations. We will then zoom in on several illustrative case studies from the Middle East, including Israel, Lebanon, Iraq and Syria.
NES3927;;;Understanding Israeli-Lebanese Relations;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;GOVT3927;;;Since the establishment of the State of Israel and the First Arab-Israeli War in 1948, Israeli-Lebanese relations have known periods of stability and conflict. The course will explain the changing relationship between the two states focusing on their particular characteristics. More specifically, we will examine the process of state formation, pattern of inter-sectoral relations, and civil-security relations in Lebanon and Israel; compare the two states according to these criteria; and then explore the impact of these factors on the two states' changing relationship. The course will include four parts. First, we will discuss the process of state formation, inter-sectoral relations, and civil-security relationship in the Middle East. Second, we will focus on each of the two states--Lebanon and Israel--and identify their particular characteristics. Third, we will compare Israel and Lebanon according to these criteria, but also attempt to situate the two cases in a broad, theoretical and comparative perspective. Fourth, we will examine the major developments in Israeli-Lebanese relations. In addition to promoting a better understanding of Lebanon, Israel, and their relations, the course will provide tools for studying other patterns of Israeli-Arab (and non-Arab) relations.
NES4200;;;Advanced Arabic Literature;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;Prerequisite: NES 3202, or no less than a grade of "A" in NES 3201, or permission of the instructor.;;;;;;The course is an introductory survey to different genres in Modern Arabic Literature (Poetry and prose). It aims at improving the four language skills at an advanced level, as well as appreciating Arabic literature. All readings will be in Arabic. The readings are selected from among the most salient literary texts by major writers form the 20th century.
NES4210;;;Arabic Grammar and Writing (in Arabic);;;4;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;Prerequisite: NES 3202.;;;;;;This course, taught entirely in Arabic, will focus on those aspects of Arabic grammar that are relevant for the correct reading and writing of Modern Standard Arabic such as the case and mood system (I'raab), the construct (IDaafa), the verb forms and their derivatives, different passive constructions, the number and gender systems, and different types of agreement. The readings will consist of a variety of texts (short stories, newspaper articles, poems, and biographies) which will be used as a basis for writing compositions.
NES4214;;;Tales from the Thousand and One Nights;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;Prerequisite: NES 3202 or permission of the instructor.;;;;;;The Thousand and One Nights is a collection of "Oriental" stories of uncertain date and authorship, which are told by the brave and wise " Shehrezad" in an attempt to save the lives of other women of her kingdom and the kingdom itself from her new husband king "Shehrayar", who after finding his wife in bed with another man vowed in a fit of rage to sleep with a different woman every night and kill her the following day. Shehrezad's strategy was to start a story every night and stop short of finishing it promising Shehrayar to finish it the following night. Shehrayar, anxious to know how the story ends, spares Shehrezad's life one more night. The story-telling continues for a thousand nights. In the meantime, Shehrezad has a son by Shehrayar, who then spares her life so she can take care of his son and subsequently stops his murderous campaign.

NES4525;;;Palestinians in Israel;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;Prerequisite: Reading skills in Arabic and Hebrew.;;;JWST4525;;;Following the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948 and the first Arab-Israeli war, over 150,000 Palestinian Arabs remained in Israel. Referred to by the Arab media as "1948 Arabs" or "Arabs within" and by the Israeli media as "Israeli Arabs" or "the Arab sector," this community is often overlooked in discussions about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the peace process. In this seminar we will focus our attention on the history, experiences, and identity of this marginalized, and largely bilingual community. We will read and discuss a range of texts in Hebrew and Arabic by and about Palestinian-Israelis. Readings will include historical and sociological studies, journalism, and literature. Students are expected to have achieved an advanced level of either Hebrew or Arabic and an intermediate level of the other language.
NES4557;;;Desert Monasticism;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;CLASS4677;JWST4557;MEDVL4557;RELST4557;;;How and why do landscapes come to inspire the religious imagination? And how do sensory landscapes, more specifically-territories of sight, sound, touch, taste, and smell-inform, inflect, and engage the religious imagination? When and why do religious practices, rituals, traditions, and beliefs inhabit particular landscapes? This seminar treats these questions by focusing on a particular landscape-the "desert," both imagined and real-as it has shaped religious ascetic practice. Biblical notions of howling desert wastelands and subsequent ideas about deserts inhabited by terrifying and grotesque demons; paradise, a garden where angels' wings whir and pure light shines; valleys of rattling dry bones, sinews, and skins that breathe with new life; heavens clanging with the sound of war between seven-headed dragons and angels; demons coming in the forms of roaring lions and hissing serpents-the religious imaginary is shaped in striking ways by sensory landscapes. We will read widely from desert Christian monastic literatures, mostly from late ancient Egypt, to explore both the historical development of monasticism in Christianity and examine why the monastic impulse seems so closely tied to the "desert." In addition to reading saints lives, we will read early monastic rules, the desert fathers, and we will draw from archaeological sources to examine the varieties of ascetic practices in the deserts of late ancient Egypt, Gaza, Sinai, Palestine, and Syria. Throughout the course we will explore ancient and modern ideas about "wilderness" and we will explore parallels between ancient Near Eastern literatures and their nineteenth- and twentieth-century parallels in the American frontier and environmental literatures.
NES4560;;;Theory and Method in Near Eastern Studies;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;;;;Seminar offering advanced Near Eastern Studies students the opportunity to read and discuss the range of theories and methods that have been employed by scholars in the interdisciplinary area of Near Eastern Studies. After giving attention to the historical development of area studies programs--and their current status and relevance--students read a wide range of highly influential works in Near Eastern Studies. Literary theory, historiography, post-colonialism, archaeology, gender theory, and comparative religions are a few of the approaches, methods, and theories explored. Authors include Talal Asad, Homi K. Bhabha, Mircea Eliade, Timothy Mitchell, Mary Douglas, Zachary Lockman, Edward Said, J. Z. Smith.
NES4618;;;Seminar in Early Islamic History: The Emergence of Islam: 600-750;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;HIST4614;RELST4618;;;An examination of Islamic history from 600-750, with special attention to historiography and interpretive issues. Topics to be discussed will include: Arabia and the Near East before Islam; the collection of the Qur'an, the biography of Muhammad, the Arab conquests, the Umayyad caliphs, and the Abbasid takeover.
NES4620;;;Archaeology of Orientalism;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;ANTHR4120;ANTHR6120;ARKEO4120;ARKEO6120;CLASS4760;NES6620;;;What is the relationship between archaeology and politics? What role has archaeology played in the making of "the East"? And how has material culture been implicated in the discourses that conjure the East into existence? This course probes the archaeology of Orientalism in two respects. Most immediately, it examines the attitudes that have shaped archaeologies of the Near East from the discipline's imperialist beginnings to the present, considering several key tropes of the field (from "civilization" to "oriental despotism" and beyond). In another sense, our concern is the materiality of Orientalism, or the work of things in enabling various dispositions toward the Near East. We also consider Orientalism's antipode, nationalism, examining some of the region's indigenous archaeological approaches and the politics of archaeology today.
NES4622;;;Geopolitics of Europe's East: 1700-Present;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;HIST4522;;;Two places have dominated the headlines over the past year: Ukraine and Syria/Iraq. Both have deep roots in the history of the Ottoman Empire's slow diminution and Russia's expansion starting in the 18th century. This course will examine different perspectives on a period when Eastern and Southeastern Europe were at the center of a contest between competing empires and emerging nation-states. Readings will be mostly primary sources by Russian, Polish, Turkish, Greek, Ukrainian, Arab, Bulgarian, German and other authors. Themes will include the emergence of pan-Slavism and pan-Turanism, federative schemes, how ideologies such as fascism and communism influenced interstate relations, and the cultural progeny (literature, art, music, etc.) of visions for a future regional order.
NES4628;;;Gnosticism and Early Christianity;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;CLASS4636;JWST4628;RELST4628;;;What is "Gnosticism" and why has it come to be so hotly debated among scholars and in our contemporary media? What is the Gospel of Judas and are its ideas "heretical"? Who wrote the Gospel of Thomas and the Gospel of Mary and why were these Gospels not included in the New Testament canon? To what extent did Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code draw from ancient Christian gnostic sources? This seminar will explore answers to these questions and many others by focusing on the complex array of literary sources from late antiquity-primarily from a cache of manuscripts found at Nag Hammadi, Egypt, in 1945-that have long been associated with a so-called "Christian Gnosticism." Church Fathers condemned the "movement" on a variety of grounds, but in this course we will not simply read the condemnations written by the opponents of gnostic thought; rather, we will focus our attention on reading (in English translation) substantial portions of the "gnostic" texts written by the adherents themselves. We will give special attention to the ways in which conflicts about Gnosticism connected with conflicts about gender, heresy, power, and authority. To set these texts within a socio-historical context, we will discuss the possible Jewish and hellenistic roots of early Christian Gnosticism and ties to Stoic and other ancient philosophical movements.
NES4634;;;Shi'i Islam in Southeast Asia;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;Prerequisite: one course on Islam/Middle Eastern studies or permission of instructor.;;;ASIAN4434;ASIAN6634;RELST4434;;;Structured as a seminar, this course explores various aspects of Shi'i Islam (in cultural, literary, intellectual, ritual, legal, and political terms) in its historical emergence and contemporary manifestations across Southeast Asia. Departing from an analysis of forms of devotion towards the 'Alid members of prophet Muhammad's family (scriptures and ritual), class discussions will address issues such as constructions of sectarian identities (Sunni versus Shi'i), the role of transnational flows in shaping Shi'i communities across the region, Muslim-majority governments' reactions to the emergence of such communities, and broader debates on orthodoxy and 'deviation' (both within and between Islamic traditions). Although lectures at the beginning will cover the historical process by which Shi'i Islam came into shape, this will be pursued critically, and students are expected to have foundational knowledge of Islam's theology and history.
NES4641;;;WWI & the Emergence of the Modern Middle East;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;HIST4544;HIST6544;NES6641;;;It is hard to think of a region in the world that changed more drastically during the course of World War I, than that of the Middle East. For the war not only spelled the end of an empire that had united the region for well over 400 years, but it also meant the creation of new national borders, new state structures, colonial occupation, the entrenchment of settler colonialism, and a drastic upheaval in traditional socio-cultural orders. Despite the important role that the Ottoman Empire played in the war, and the deep and long-lasting impact the war had on the region, academic interests in the Great War has mostly focused on European experiences. This seminar, which will be offered in conjunction with a number of events taking place on campus, will turn the spotlight onto this important topic. Even though classic texts will be used in this seminar, the focus will be on newer scholarship dealing with the social and political history of the Ottoman Empire on the eve of the war, the experience of the war on the frontline and at home in the Middle East, and the impact of the war on the region in the first half of the 20th century. Thematically, the course will focus on trials of imperialism at the end of the 19th century, the study of the emergence of new forms of complex identifications in the region, the long-term impact of colonialism, and the emergence of nationalism. A basic background in the history of the region is strongly preferred, but not required.
NES4642;;;Women in the Modern Middle East;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;FGSS4640;HIST4642;;;The primary emphasis of this discussion seminar is the historical development of gendered identities and the fluid manner in which different Middle Eastern communities responded to shifting ideas of sexuality, reproduction, and the family. Our focus of inquiry will be on themes that involve and relate to women, both directly and indirectly. We will particularly examine how and why women's status differs from one Middle Eastern country or region to another. From both theoretical and topical points of view, we will consider some of the most recent literature about women and gender. Since this is a history course, we will also examine how women's roles, as well as gendered systems and institutions, have changed over time.
NES4670;;;Wealth and Power: Political Economy in Ancient Near Eastern States;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;ARKEO4670;JWST4670;;;Early states emerged when select groups gained control over wealth and power and institutionalized that control. How this was accomplished is a question of political economy that we can approach from archaeological, anthropological, and sociological perspectives. The course introduces students to the intellectual development of historical materialism in Smith, Marx, and Weber, among others, and traces their influence on later socioeconomic historians such as Polanyi and Finley. More recent approaches deriving from world-systems, gender studies, post-colonial studies, game theory, and network theory are then applied to case studies that include the emergence of a Mesopotamian state ca. 3400 BC, the Akkadian and Ur III empires, Old Babylonian and Old Assyrian trade, pharaonic Egypt, the international Late Bronze Age world, Aegean palatial civilization, and the Phoenicians. Students are welcome to present and write on other topics also. Monroe will provide context and clarification to assist with the specialist literature, but prior coursework in ancient studies will be advantageous in critically evaluating and writing about all the course readings.

Guided by the critical work of e.g. Hawley, Rushdie, and Subramani, we will read and watch the works of Leila Aboulela, Zulfikar Ghose, Abdulrazak Gurnah, Mohja Kahf, Sorayya Khan, Manzu Islam, Hanif Kureishi, Ian Iqbal Rashid and others. We will critique, evaluate, and enjoy these works through the lens of the diasporic condition, by paying special attention to the effects of displacement and its impact on articulations of faith, history, identity, memory, mythologies, nation(alism), subjugation, the postmodern, and the (post)postcolonial. All readings and films in English.
NES4776;;;Talmud and the Art of Reading;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;CLASS4637;JWST4776;RELST4776;;;The Babylonian Talmud has long been viewed as the central text of post-Biblical Judaism.  Yet little is known about who wrote it and when it was written.  Since the Talmud is an extremely difficult text to master, its readership has therefore until recently been limited to few expert traditional scholars.  Over the past fifty or so years, with the advent of translations and study guides, the Talmud has gained increasing popularity. The Talmud has long been viewed as a source for history, law, or moral lessons. But literature interacts with the cultures that produce and read it in far more nuanced and significant ways. In the past century, advances in theories of how and why to read literature have opened up new avenues for understanding what the Talmud says and, more importantly, how it works . This course will examine provocative, bizarre, and salacious Talmud passages through the lens of the evolution of the major theoretical schools of the past century. Each week we will explore a theoretical movement ( e.g. New Criticism, Formalism, Post-Stucturalism, Feminist Criticism, New Historicism , etc .) and apply their reading strategies to close readings of Talmud passages.  We will simultaneously read the work of modern Talmud scholars whose reading practices align with each of these theoretical schools.  All Texts will be read in translation and no previous knowledge of Talmud or Critical Theory is necessary.
NES4910;;;East European Jewish Culture;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ANTHR4810;ANTHR7810;JWST4910;JWST7910;NES7910;;;An autonomous, diasporic Jewish culture flourished in Eastern Europe from the early modern period through the mid-twentieth century and beyond. It is the ancestral culture of the vast majority of American Jews today, and thus a major source of American culture more generally. Its productions span the range of the religious and the secular, and trouble those very categories. Its reford constitutes a treasure trove of reflections on universality and particularity, self-determination and domination, the search for individual expression and the call of collective solidarity. This course will draw on a wide range of disciplines (especially anthropology, history, and literary studies) and a wide range of genres (fiction, historiography, autobiography, film) to recapture some sense of the living, dynamic cultural world of East European Jews.

Yet since World War II, his influence, his reputation, and his fascination for scholars in a wide range of cultural and political disciplines has steadily grown. He is seen as a bridging figure between German and Jewish studies, between materialist critique of culture and the submerged yet powerful voice of theology, between literary history and philosophy. We will review Benjamin's life and some of the key disputes over his heritage; read some of the best-known of his essays; and devote significant time to his enigmatic and enormously rich masterwork, the Arcades Project, concluding with consideration of the relevance of Benjamin's insights for cultural and political dilemmas today.

NES7910;;;East European Jewish Culture;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;ANTHR4810;ANTHR7810;JWST4910;JWST7910;NES4910;;;An autonomous, diasporic Jewish culture flourished in Eastern Europe from the early modern period through the mid-twentieth century and beyond. It is the ancestral culture of the vast majority of American Jews today, and thus a major source of American culture more generally. Its productions span the range of the religious and the secular, and trouble those very categories. Its reford constitutes a treasure trove of reflections on universality and particularity, self-determination and domination, the search for individual expression and the call of collective solidarity. This course will draw on a wide range of disciplines (especially anthropology, history, and literary studies) and a wide range of genres (fiction, historiography, autobiography, film) to recapture some sense of the living, dynamic cultural world of East European Jews.
NES7913;;;Walter Benjamin;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;ANTHR4413;ANTHR7413;COML4429;COML6429;GERST4413;GERST6413;JWST4913;JWST7913;NES4913;;;This extraordinary figure died in 1941, and his death  is emblematic of the intellectual depradations of Nazism. Yet since World War II, his influence, his reputation, and his fascination for scholars in a wide range of cultural and political disciplines has steadily grown. He is seen as a bridging figure between German and Jewish studies, between materialist critique of culture and the submerged yet powerful voice of theology, between literary history and philosophy. We will review Benjamin's life and some of the key disputes over his heritage; read some of the best-known of his essays; and devote significant time to his enigmatic and enormously rich masterwork, the Arcades Project, concluding with consideration of the relevance of Benjamin's insights for cultural and political dilemmas today.

We move on to several basic policy rationales for intervention in a market. Those include externalities, public goods, natural monopoly, and contracting problems, among others. We consider various forms of intervention, including taxes and subsidies, industry and economy-wide regulation, as well as innovative approaches such as tradable property rights and permits. Both normative and positive theories of regulation are examined, including the capture, economic (or private interest), pure public interest, and hybrid theories. Those approaches are applied to specific types of regulation, including individual industry-level regulation (e.g. electricity, trucking, postal services), as well as to broader social regulation (e.g. health, safety, environment). The effect of deregulation and other regulatory reforms in several industries will be assessed. Current policy issues related to government intervention in the marketplace will also be discussed along the way.

PAM5334;;;Corporations, Shareholders, and Policy;;;3;;;Spring.;;;;;;Prerequisite: Principles of Microeconomics; Principles of Statistics.;;;;;;The term "firm" has very broad usage. It refers to any organizational form that people use to create teams or groups that focus on achieving a specific purpose. Firms provide a structure through which people can organize themselves into those groups or teams. They are categorized by the nature of the property rights owners hold in the firm, and by the details of the firm's contractual arrangements. Common firm types include partnerships, sole proprietorships, non-profits, mutuals, and publicly traded corporations, among others. This course focuses on one important firm type: the modern publicly traded, privately owned corporation. The course uses economic and statistical analysis to study the interaction of the public corporation, the market, and the law, and how those interactions affect the welfare of managers, shareholders and consumers. The costs and benefits of that standard corporate form of organization are examined. A variety of legal institutions, some of which have evolved over decades, are analyzed. Those institutions define and govern the corporation. They include limited liability, fiduciary duties, the business judgment rule, and shareholder voting. The mechanisms of corporate governance, i.e., those legal and market-based forces that help control the corporation and ensure that managers operate it in shareholders' interest, are examined. Corporate governance mechanisms include hostile takeovers, insider trading, outside directors on the board, the monitoring role of institutional investors, audits, and executive compensation plans. State corporate law and anti-takeover devices are also discussed. The role and impact of federal policies, such as the 1933-34 Exchange Acts, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Act in affecting corporate structure and managerial behavior will be an important focus. Other institutions and policies related to publicly traded corporations, such as sovereign wealth funds and government-sponsored enterprises, will also be examined along the way.

PAM6820;;;Linear Models;;;4;;;;;;;;;;;;SOC6020;;;This course provides an in-depth examination of linear modeling. We begin with the basics of linear regression, including estimation, statistical inference, and model assumptions. We then review several tools for diagnosing violations of statistical assumptions and what to do when things go wrong, including dealing with outliers, missing data, omitted variables, and weights. Finally, we will explore extensions of the linear regression model, including models for categorical outcomes and hierarchical linear modeling. While statistical modeling is the focus of the course, we proceed with the assumption that models are only as good as the theoretical and substantive knowledge behind them. Thus, in covering the technical material, we will spend considerable time discussing the link between substantive knowledge and statistical practice. The course is designed primarily for graduate students in sociology.
PAM6970;;;Empirical Public Finance and Taxation;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;ECON6970;;;The principal objective of this course is to explore empirical evidence on the role of government intervention in the economy.

PHIL1440;;;Ethics of Eating;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(KCM-AS);;;;;;;;;We all face difficult moral decisions on occasion. This course introduces students to the idea that we face such a decision several times a day in deciding what to eat. How should facts about animal life and death inform this decision? Is the suffering involved in meat, egg, and dairy production really bad enough to make the practices immoral? How do our dietary choices affect local and non-local economies, the environment, and other people generally? Finally, given the deep connections between eating practices and various ethnic, religious and class identities, how can we implement a reasonable food policy for an expanding world population while also respecting these important differences? The goal of this course is not to teach some preferred set of answers to these questions. The goal is rather to give participants the basic tools required to reflect clearly and effectively on the questions themselves. These tools include a working knowledge of the major moral theories developed by philosophers, and an understanding of basic empirical issues related to food production, distribution, consumption, and disposal. In addition to readings, lectures, and required sections, the course will involve trips to some local food-production facilities, as well as supplemental lectures by experts from Cornell, Ithaca, and beyond.
PHIL1900;;;Bethe Ansatz: Building a Life Worth Living;;;1;;;Fall, spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;On a weekly basis, Bethe Ansatz brings together students, Cornell faculty, and other distinguished guests for informal, substantive engagement around a wide range of issues and endeavors: intellectual, cultural, artistic, scientific, moral, social, and political. Weekly seminar meetings, chaired by the instructor, will feature a guest who is typically a member of the Cornell faculty, a visiting professor, or other visiting scientist, scholar, artist, or public figure. The conversational format, which encourages discussion and interaction, allows students to discover for themselves the intrinsic interest and reward of a life characterized by broad, vital intellectual curiosity and engagement.
PHIL1910;;;Introduction to Cognitive Science;;;3-4;;;Spring.;;;(KCM-AS);;;;;;COGST1101;CS1710;LING1170;PSYCH1102;;;Surveys the study of how the mind/brain works. Examines how intelligent information processing can arise from biological and artificial systems. Draws primarily from five disciplines that make major contributions to cognitive science: philosophy, psychology, neuroscience, linguistics, and computer science. The first part of the course introduces the roles played by these disciplines in cognitive science. The second part focuses on how each of these disciplines contributes to the study of five topics in cognitive science: language, vision, learning and memory, action, and artificial intelligence.
PHIL1930;;;Equality, Liberty, and Democracy;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(KCM-AS);;;;;;GOVT2935;SOC2930;;;An interdisciplinary discussion of economic inequality, civil, political and economic liberty and democracy. Some specific questions that we will consider are: In what ways and to what extent are Americans economically unequal? What are the major causes of American inequality and poverty? To what extent should inequality and poverty be changed by political means?  How should governments deal with religious diversity and other differences in ultimate values, which give rise, for example, to radically different attitudes toward abortion, sexuality, and the preservation of unspoiled nature?  Moral argument, empirical findings and theories of social causes interact in the search for answers to these questions. Our readings will derive from many disciplines and areas of public life, including political philosophy, sociology, economics, and political science.
PHIL1950;;;Controversies About Inequality;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;DSOC2220;GOVT2225;ILROB2220;PAM2220;SOC2220;;;In recent years, poverty and inequality have become increasingly common topics of public debate, as academics, journalists, and politicians attempt to come to terms with growing income inequality, with the increasing visibility of inter-country differences in wealth and income, and with the persistence of racial, ethnic, and gender stratification. This course introduces students to ongoing social scientific debates about the sources and consequences of inequality, as well as the types of public policy that might appropriately be pursued to reduce (or increase) inequality. These topics will be addressed in related unites, some of which include guest lectures by faculty from other universities (funded by the Center for the Study of Inequality). Each unit culminates with a highly spirited class discussion and debate.
PHIL2200;;;Ancient Philosophy;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(KCM-AS);;;;;;CLASS2661;;;An introductory survey of ancient Greek philosophy from the so-called Presocratics (6th century BCE) through the Hellenistic period (1st century BCE) with special emphasis on the thought of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle.
PHIL2220;;;Modern Philosophy;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(KCM-AS);;;;;;;;;A survey of Western philosophy in the 17th and 18th centuries: Descartes, Locke, Spinoza, Leibniz, Berkeley, Hume, and Kant. We focus largely on epistemology (ideas, skepticism, belief, knowledge, science) and metaphysics (bodies, minds, God, causation, natural laws, afterlife, personal identity). Some of the ethical implications of these systems will also be mentioned in passing.
PHIL2240;;;Nineteenth and Twentieth Century European Thought;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(KCM-AS);;;;;;GERST3530;;;Survey of European social theory from Hegel to Foucault (via Marx, Nietzsche, Freud, Weber, and the Frankfurt School).
PHIL2310;;;Introduction to Deductive Logic;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(MQR);;;;;;;;;Covers sentential languages, the truth-functional connectives, and their logic; first-order languages, the quantifiers "every" and "some," and their logic.
PHIL2410;;;Ethics;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(KCM-AS);;;;;;;;;This course is intended to introduce and explore some of the big questions about the content, scope, and nature of morality. The first half of the course will focus on various first-order ethical theories, which offer criteria of morally right action. These will include consequentialist and deontological approaches, and also broadly virtue-theoretic approaches, which place more emphasis on the notion of moral character and/or are critical of focusing exclusively on what one ought to do as opposed to who one ought to be. The second half of the course will examine some of the more abstract questions about the nature of morality which are the province of twentieth-century metaethics. What is the nature of moral properties? Where in the world might they be located? Are they objective, subjective, and/or relative to particular times and places? What is the connection between morality, moral judgments, and being motivated to act morally? Interspersed with these theoretical ethical issues will be more concrete ethical questions about what to do as individuals in an often unjust social world.
PHIL2420;;;Social and Political Philosophy;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(KCM-AS);;;;;;GOVT2605;;;This course will examine key issues in social and political philosophy. Topics may include the legitimacy of the state, political obligation, the nature and demands of justice, equality, liberty, and autonomy. Selected readings may be drawn from historical as well as contemporary sources.
PHIL2450;;;Ethics and Health Care;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(KCM-AS);;;;;;;;;An introduction to the philosophical study of ethical problems that arise from the practice of medicine as such or that arise in response to developments within medicine and the larger world.
PHIL2460;;;Ethics and the Environment;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(KCM-AS);;;;;;BSOC2061;STS2061;;;Politicians, scientists, and citizens worldwide face many environmental issues today, but they are neither simple nor straightforward. Moreover, there are many ways to understand how we have, do, and could value the environment from animal rights and wise use to deep ecology and ecofeminism. This class acquaints students with some of the challenging moral issues that arise in the context of environmental management and policy-making, both in the past and the present. Environmental concerns also highlight important economic, epistemological, legal, political, and social issues in assessing our moral obligations to nature as well as other humans. This course examines various perspectives expressed in both contemporary and historical debates over environmental ethics by exploring four central questions: What is nature? Who counts in environmental ethics? How do we know nature? Whose nature?
PHIL2525;;;Introduction to African Philosophy;;;4;;;;;;;;;;;;ASRC2020;;;The central questions of philosophy are perennial and universal. But the answers that are given to them are always historical and idiomatic.  This course aims to introduce its enrollees to how these questions have been answered in the global African world made up of, specifically Africans, African Americans, and peoples of African descent in the African Diaspora; how they have thought about and sought to make sense of or solve some of the same philosophical problems that have remained at the core of the "Western" tradition. The readings for the course are chosen from a global African perspective. This does not mean that we will not read any of the 'traditional' texts. What it means is that we will be yielding the pride of place to much maligned and characteristically absent from the "mainstream" philosophical traditions and the ideas of people that are not normally considered worthy of study in the American academy. We wish to broaden our repertoire so that, at the end of the class, our knowledge will reflect the comparative perspectives that studying different traditions can offer while at the same time giving us access to the wisdom of peoples other than our own.
PHIL2530;;;Religion and Reason;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(KCM-AS);;;;;;RELST2630;;;In this course we will examine some of the major arguments regarding the existence and nature of a supreme being - ontological, cosmological, teleological, Pascalian, and moral arguments. We will also discuss the most significant argument against the existence of the classical God - namely, the argument from evil and suffering. After that, we will look at whether religious belief might be rational without theoretical proof or empirical evidence, whether religious experience is an intelligible notion, and whether the real-world fact of religious diversity has philosophical implications. Time permitting, we will conclude by reflecting on two prominent religious ideas: miracles and the afterlife. Course readings will be taken from both historical and contemporary sources.
PHIL2610;;;Knowledge and Reality;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(KCM-AS);;;;;;;;;An introduction to some central philosophical questions about knowledge and reality. Questions to be addressed may include: What, if anything, do we know? What is it for a belief to be reasonable? What is it for one event to cause another event? What makes the person reading the beginning of this sentence the same as the person reading the end of this sentence? Readings are typically drawn from recent sources.
PHIL2621;;;Minds and Machines;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(KCM-AS);;;;;;;;;Throughout history, metaphors drawn from technology of the time have been proposed to understand how the mind works. While Locke likened the newborn's mind to a blank slate, Freud compared the mind to hydraulic and electro-magnetic systems. More recently, many have endorsed Turing's proposal that the mind is a computer. Why is this idea attractive and what exactly is a computer? Is it at all plausible that the cells of your brain are computing? Could a computer ever really have a mind, beliefs, emotions and conscious experiences? What are these mysterious things anyway? Could a machine ever count as a person and make choices based on its own free will? Is it really so clear that we have this kind of free will?
PHIL2640;;;Introduction to Metaphysics;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(KCM-AS);;;;;;;;;This course is an introduction to some of the central questions in metaphysics--the study of what there is and how it works. Possible topics include persistence through change, freedom of the will, the nature of time (and the possibility of time travel), causation, properties, and necessity.
PHIL3202;;;Plato;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(KCM-AS);;;Prerequisite: at least one previous course in philosophy at 2000 level or above; or permission of instructor.;;;CLASS3669;;;We will study several of Plato's major dialogues, including the Apology, the Meno, Phaedo, and Republic. Topics include knowledge and reality; morality and happiness; and the nature of the soul.
PHIL3204;;;Hellenistic Philosophy;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(KCM-AS);;;;;;CLASS3661;;;An examination of the doctrines of the Greek philosophers working in the three centuries after the death of Aristotle. Emphasis on Stoicism, Epicureanism, and Skepticism.
PHIL3210;;;Medieval Philosophy;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(KCM-AS);;;;;;MEDVL3210;RELST3150;;;A selective survey of Western philosophical thought from the fourth to the 14th century. Topics include the problem of universals, the theory of knowledge and truth, the nature of free choice and practical reasoning, and philosophical theology. Readings (in translation) include Augustine, Boethius, Anselm, Abelard, Aquinas, Scotus, and Ockham. Some attention will be given to the development of ideas across the period and the influence of non-Western traditions on the West.
PHIL3300;;;The Foundations of Mathematics;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(MQR);;;;;;MATH3840;;;This will be a course on the set theory of Zermelo and Fraenkel: the basic concepts, set-theoretic construction of the Natural, Integral, Rational and Real Numbers, cardinality, and, time permitting, the ordinals.
PHIL3320;;;Logic for Philosophy;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(KCM-AS);;;Prerequisite: One of the following: PHIL 2310, MATH 2210, MATH 2230, or permission of instructor.;;;;;;The goal of this course is "logic literacy." Contemporary philosophy is steeped in logic: in order to read journal articles and take part in discussions, one needs to know a certain amount of logic. We will study i) the basic techniques of logic, including syntax, semantics, proof theory, metalogic, and a bit of philosophy of logic; and ii) a number of extensions of standard logic that are important in philosophy (for example, intuitionist logic, modal logic, counterfactuals). The course will be more broad than deep: we will examine many different systems, but will not spend a lot of time proving difficult metalogical results about these systems (except for completeness in propositional modal logic).
PHIL3403;;;Aristotle's Ethical Theory;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(KCM-AS);;;;;;;;;In this course, we will investigate Aristotle's understanding of the psychological states, processes, and acts that play central roles in his theory of moral psychology and the human good. Topics covered will include Aristotle's views on desire, emotion, pleasure, imagination (phantasia), deliberation, decision (prohairesis), weakness of will, and the formation of character. The texts that will receive the most focus are Aristotle's ethical treatises (Nicomachean Ethics,Eudemian Ethics), his psychological treatises (De Anima, De Motu Animalium), and the Rhetoric. By looking at these psychological states, we'll have a better understanding of what, in his mind, the good human life involves.
PHIL3410;;;Ethical Theory;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(KCM-AS);;;Prerequisite: one previous course in Philosophy is recommended but not required.;;;;;;The theme of this course is "Modern Moral Philosophy," the title of G.E.M. Anscombe's famous indictment of hitherto dominant approaches to ethics. Anscombe's paper (published in 1958) played an important role in animating the approach to ethics now known as virtue ethics, according to which the cultivation of character gains emphasis over ethical principles, rules, and formulas. This course will be a detailed excursion into virtue ethics as it has developed over the last fifty-odd years, along with other, similarly eclectic approaches which elude straightforward categorization. Readings will include famous papers in modern moral philosophy by Iris Murdoch, Bernard Williams, Cora Diamond, Michael Stocker, Alisdair MacIntye, Philippa Foot, and John McDowell, as well as Anscombe.

PHIL3480;;;Philosophy of Law;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(KCM-AS);;;Prerequisite: one previous course in philosophy.;;;;;;Explores the most important debates in contemporary philosophy of law. We will examine the distinction between law and other social practices, the relation of law and morality, the problem of legal authority, and the nature of adjudication and legal interpretation. In so doing, we will analyze and evaluate the main jurisprudential schools of thought: legal positivism, legal realism, critical legal studies, and natural law theory. This course is intended for undergraduate and graduate students interested in the philosophy of law, jurisprudence, and social/political philosophy; appropriate for advanced undergraduate, graduate, and law students.
PHIL3640;;;Metaphysics;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(KCM-AS);;;;;;;;;Consciousness, Free Will, and Physicalism:    Do facts about consciousness and free will conflict with the hypothesis that we are completely physical beings?  In this course we will first assess the two most influential arguments for the impossibility of a physical account of the consciousness: the knowledge and conceivability arguments. We will then use these assessments to evaluate a number of possible positions in the ontology of mind. Is the best physicalism eliminativist, reductionist, or anti-reductionist?  Is the best anti-physicalism substance dualist, property dualist, idealist, Russellian monist, or panpsychist?  Lastly, we will consider the consequences that physicalism has for the claim that we have free will.

PHIL6422;;;Foundations of the Social Sciences;;;4;;;;;;;;;;;;ECON6910;GOVT6122;;;Social science research almost always combines empirical observation (data), the construction of concepts (language), and the logical analysis of the relations between observations and concepts (statistics).  This course examines the relations between these three dimensions as the analyst moves from one to the other both as practice and in the crafting of a formal summary of findings and argument. We will be particularly interested in the foundational assumptions that underpin the connections between empirical reality, language, and statistical analysis. While these foundational assumptions are often taken for granted by social scientists, they vary dramatically between social science disciplines.  The implicit contradiction between that variance and their doxic acceptance within disciplines will be a primary focus of the course.

Genetic engineering (recombinant DNA technology) is one class of methods used in biotechnology. Private sector firms are actively marketing transgenic crops and other products of biotechnology globally. The public sector has been somewhat less active, but is becoming increasingly involved in transgenic technologies, particularly in less-industrialized countries. Developmental questions begin with those we ask of all technology: at whose cost, to whose benefit? Social movements have arisen to block both the testing and commercializing of biotechnology products, arguing that the developmental consequences are negative. Their objections center on the issues of food sovereignty, effects of land use change on the environment, ownership of transgenic traits and the genetic background in which they are placed (intellectual property), environmental uncertainties/risks, control of the food supply by multinational corporations and human health issues. Students will evaluate the legitimacy of various arguments and political positions relative to scientific findings and cultural norms.

PLPA2010;;;Magical Mushrooms, Mischievous Molds;;;2;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;PLPA2013;PLPA2015;;;Presentation of the fungi and their roles in nature and in shaping past and present civilizations. Emphasizes the historical and practical significance of fungi as decayers of organic matter, as pathogens of plants and animals, as food, and as sources of mind-altering chemicals.
PLPA2013;;;Mushrooms, Molds, and More;;;3;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;PLPA2010;PLPA2015;;;Lectures and exams for this course are the same as those in PLPA 2010. However, students in PLPA 2013 also participate in a weekly 55-minute discussion section where they grow mushrooms and other fungi in culture, learn about contemporary classification of fungi, see examples of major taxa growing on natural substrates, and determine whether suspect pathogens really can kill agricultural crops. Students also teach their peers about the fungus world with presentations of their own creation. (CALS non-life science majors can receive college physical/life science distribution credits upon completion of this course but they must register for a letter grade. This course is also on the Arts and Sciences list of supplementary science courses and can be used to satisfy Physical and Biological Sciences distribution requirements in AS.)
PLPA2015;;;Mushrooms, Molds, and Molecules;;;3;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;PLPA2010;PLPA2013;;;PLPA 2015 is a three-credit course, in two parts. The one-credit Mushrooms, Molds, and Molecules portion of the course is offered in partnership with the two-credit Magical Mushrooms, Mischievous Molds, PLPA 2010, portion of the course offered by Professor Kathie Hodge. Students in Mushrooms, Molds and Molecules participate in a weekly 50-minute lecture/discussion section which provides in-depth exposure to some of the issues raised in the Magical Mushrooms, Michievous Molds lectures. In Mushrooms, Molds, and Molecules, experts emphasize that fungi produce myriads of molecules that are beneficial to other organisms (e.g., antibiotics, immune-suppressants, biocontrol agents) or to themselves (e.g. for communication, development, reproduction, nutrient gathering, stress reduction), or detrimental to other organisms (e.g. toxins, poisons, allergens, hallucinogens). Although this course will be more in-depth than Magical Mushrooms, Mishievous Molds, it does not assume a scientific background, and there are no prerequisites. Testing and other course requirements for Mushrooms, Molds and Molecules are in addition to those for Magical Mushrooms, Mischievous Molds, although there is only one final grade.

PMA3505;;;Blaxploitation Film and Photography;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;AMST3515;ARTH3505;ASRC3505;FGSS3505;VISST3505;;;Blaxploitation films of the 1970s are remembered for their gigantic Afros, enormous guns, slammin' soundtracks, sex, drugs, nudity, and violence. Never before or since have so many African American performers been featured in starring roles. Macho male images were projected alongside strong, yet sexually submissive female ones. But how did these images affect the roles that black men and women played on and off the screen and the portrayal of the black body in contemporary society? This interdisciplinary course explores the range of ideas and methods used by critical thinkers in addressing the body in art, film, photography and the media. We will consider how the display of the black body affects how we see and interpret the world by examining the construction of beauty, fashion, hairstyles and gendered images as well as sexuality, violence, race, and hip-hop culture.

We will consider the ways in which theatre has contributed to the construction and deconstruction of a national identity. Similarly, we will examine the influence of the American Theatre on and in film. We will pay special attention to the social, political, and aesthetic contexts of the time period and discuss the shifting popularity of dramatic forms, including melodrama, realism, expressionism, absurdism, and the folk play, in the American theatre canon. Authors include O'Neill, Glaspell, Odets, Rice, Hellman, Hughes, Miller, Williams, and Albee, among others.
PMA3770;;;Shakespeare: The Late Plays;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;ENGL3270;;;The course focuses on Shakespeare's middle to late plays, from the "problem comedies," through the great tragedies, and romances. While we will pay particular attention to questions of dramatic form and historical context, the primary concentration will be on careful close readings of the play-texts themselves in relation to issues of power, politics, and performance. One of the commonplaces in Shakespeare criticism is a division between Shakespeare on the page and on the stage. Throughout the semester, we will consider what this difference could mean. On the way, we will encounter problems linked to art, sexuality, violence, identity, emotion, the body, family, God, the nation, nature and money (not necessarily in that order) - to name a few.
PMA3775;;;Global Shakespeare;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;COML3475;ENGL3475;;;From Goethe to Aime Cesaire, Orson Welles to Akira Kurosawa, Agha Hashar Kashmiri to Ariane Mnouchkine, writers, artists, actors, and directors around the world have drawn from Shakespeare's works in order to fashion their own.

PMA3815;;;Acting in Public: Performance in Everyday Life;;;3;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;;;;Telling jokes to a friend, making introductions, guiding meetings large and small, constructing and delivering business presentations, legal arguments or formal speeches are all examples of public performances.  The purpose of this course is to increase the student's effectiveness in meeting the demands and enjoying the opportunities of public performance.  The focus of this course is the student him/herself. What are the hallmarks of effective performance and how can you learn them? Employing techniques from actor/director training as well as dramatic writing, this course focuses the student on their own resources and self-imposed restrictions as a public speaker in everyday life. Subjects explored will include stage presence, audience connection, stage fright and mannerisms, speech making as storytelling, and gaining familiarity and finding comfort with one's own voice and gestures.  Public speaking will be taught as a craft that can be learned through understanding and practice.Acting skill and experience are not required to take this course.   Students must, however, be willing to attend all classes and learn by doing.  Class size limited to 12 students.

PMA4000;;;Senior Studio;;;3;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;;;;In this advanced undergraduate-level seminar, all senior majors synthesize four years of study in a collaborative intellectual and artistic project with the faculty. Over the course of the fall semester, students conceive and produce work for presentation to the public in the Schwartz Center for the Performing Arts. Students also generate a supporting scholarly matrix for that work, and their collective genesis of material integrates the major's four rubrics (history, theory, and criticism; creative authorship; design; and embodied performance). As a crucible for artistic and intellectual collaboration, the senior studio may emphasize an area of study, a period, a text, or a theme. The studio's organizing emphasis will be specific to ongoing, pressing inquiries in the disciplines of performing and media arts.
PMA4080;;;Seminar in Dance Studies;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;AAS4080;AMST4080;LSP4080;VISST4580;;;This seminar format course surveys the particular topic -- choreography -- with special attention to theories and practices of race and anti-racism. It introduces dance-based critical thinking, critical viewing, and research writing through written texts, recorded music and embodied performances mostly located in North America. Canonical and emergent dance research texts serve as principle lenses through which seminar discussions, presentations, and workshops, and writing will emerge. This specialized course takes students through a broad yet interconnected range of themes including racial formation and choreography theory, whiteness, Black dancing bodies, Latinidad, choreographing Asian America, and indigenous dance. Throughout the course students engage in interdisciplinary discussions on the racialized body, close readings of dance texts, and analyses of performances. Students will then be challenged to demonstrate their own original analyses through in-class activities, discussion, and a research paper.
PMA4190;;;American Shakespeare;;;4;;;Fall, spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;AMST4194;ENGL4291;;;What is distinctive about American Shakespeare?

PMA4805;;;Parody;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;AMST4805;FGSS4270;LGBT4270;;;In A Theory of Parody, Linda Hutcheon defines parody broadly as "repetition with critical difference, which marks difference rather than similarity." Taking a cue from Hutcheon, we will consider parody as a form of meaning making that is not necessarily used in the service of ridicule. Rather, we will examine a number of late-twentieth- and early-twenty-first-century imitative works in order to distinguish the rich variety of political agendas and aesthetic rationales for recent parody. An emphasis on postmodern or contemporary performances and media that renovate images, ideas, and icons from modernism and modernity will unite our otherwise diverse efforts. Some of these efforts will also highlight what happens when an artist takes up a work made for one platform (for example, theatre, performance art, installation, cinema, television, the Web) and parodies it in another. Creators and works under consideration may range from Christopher Durang, Split Britches, and Pig Iron Theatre Company to The Simpsons, Cookie's Fortune, and Strindberg and Helium.
PMA4841;;;States of Animation;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;PMA6841;;;What does it mean to be-or to become-animated? How have thinkers ranging from ancient and modern philosophers to contemporary critical theorists conceptualized animated-ness as essence, feeling, form, or intensity? What relationship(s) between bios and zoe may be understood through the analytic of animation? And how does animation clarify-or render less legible-distinctions among subjects, objects, and things? Answering these and related questions about reanimation, hyper-animation, inter(in)animation, and the uncanny, we also test theoretical ideas about states of animation against a number of performance and media practices. Authors include Agamben, Barthes, Benjamin, Eisenstein, Freud, Hansen, Kleist, Moten, Ngai, Schneider, and Sobchack. Art objects under investigation cross platforms and genres and span a gamut from premodern puppet theatre to The Wooster Group's Poor Theatre, Disney's Snow White to Pixar's WALL-E.
PMA4866;;;Practicum in Performance Criticism and Dramaturgy;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;ENGL4766;ENGL6766;PMA6866;;;The function of the theatre critic is well understood, but the role of the dramaturg remains mysterious in the American theatre.  Yet theatre critics and dramaturgs use many of the same research, analytic, and writing skills, and need the same knowledge of history, literature, and culture, to perform their duties effectively.  This practicum, designed for advanced undergraduates and graduate students, will allow participants to develop the skills central to these complementary professions.  The course will include units on writing effective performance reviews, working with student playwrights on new script development, preparing informational materials for directors, designers and actors, writing program essays and other informational materials for audiences, script preparation for production, and selecting/preparing translations for production. While our focus will be on the theatre, students with interest in applying these skills to film/television/media or dance contexts are welcome.

How have thinkers ranging from ancient and modern philosophers to contemporary critical theorists conceptualized animated-ness as essence, feeling, form, or intensity? What relationship(s) between bios and zoe may be understood through the analytic of animation? And how does animation clarify-or render less legible-distinctions among subjects, objects, and things? Answering these and related questions about reanimation, hyper-animation, inter(in)animation, and the uncanny, we also test theoretical ideas about states of animation against a number of performance and media practices. Authors include Agamben, Barthes, Benjamin, Eisenstein, Freud, Hansen, Kleist, Moten, Ngai, Schneider, and Sobchack. Art objects under investigation cross platforms and genres and span a gamut from premodern puppet theatre to The Wooster Group's Poor Theatre, Disney's Snow White to Pixar's WALL-E.
PMA6866;;;Practicum in Performance Criticism and Dramaturgy;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;ENGL4766;ENGL6766;PMA4866;;;The function of the theatre critic is well understood, but the role of the dramaturg remains mysterious in the American theatre. Yet theatre critics and dramaturgs use many of the same research, analytic, and writing skills, and need the same knowledge of history, literature, and culture, to perform their duties effectively. This practicum, designed for advanced undergraduates and graduate students, will allow participants to develop the skills central to these complementary professions. The course will include units on writing effective performance reviews, working with student playwrights on new script development, preparing informational materials for directors, designers and actors, writing program essays and other informational materials for audiences, script preparation for production, and selecting/preparing translations for production. While our focus will be on the theatre, students with interest in applying these skills to film/television/media or dance contexts are welcome.
PMA6965;;;Digital Discourse: Humanities, Art, Theory, Archive;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;COML6932;ENGL6965;VISST6965;;;What is the relation of the theory and archival practice of the 'digital turn' to the overall question of the humanities? The course will consider a range of critical pressure points that have been central to the digital humanities and the production of new media art and theory. How have the developments of digital culture and theory impacted the critical commonplaces of archive, analogy, time, sound, motion, network, body, narrative? Does the destabilization of the archive by open source software and accumulative databases alter the conditions of academic research, the space of artistic practice, and the place of ideology critique?  How do recent trends in "media archeology" and "new materiality" correspond to or contrast with the virtuality of "new media" and the theoretical precedents of poststructuralism. In dialogue with critical paradigms that have been fundamental to the discourse of critical theory, from affect and trauma or aesthetics and archive, to colonialism and politics, sexuality and race, we will reflect on the parameters of a deeply significant archeological shift emphasized, if not wholly embodied, by the digital condition.

PORT4540;;;Between Asia and Latin America: Transpacific Trends in 20th Century Literature, Art, and Theory;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;COML4706;COML6706;PORT6540;;;Asia and Latin America no longer occupy the disconnected extremes of an imagined map. Nor do they embody the antipodes of East and West, framing Europe and North America as the symbolic centers.  Rather, accelerated by recent geopolitical and global economic shifts, new connections between Asia and Latin America revive the "swarmlike buzz of activity" around and across the perimeter of the Pacific that Claude Levi-Strauss had pitted against "the great Atlantic silence" prior to the European "discovery" of the Americas. This course explores different perspectives on the intercultural study of Asia and Latin America with the aim of rethinking the Transpacific as a method and a lens for comparison that challenges conventional geopolitical models, rather than simply an area or a region. To do so, we will explore multiple meanings, methodologies, and mappings of the Transpacific through a wide range of real and imagined links between Asian and Latin American literature, art, and theory: from diaspora, textual circulation, and cultural exchanges to uneven dialogues, compelling analogies, and conceptual affinities.

RELST2247;;;Islam in Asia;;;3;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;ASIAN2247;;;This course examines the dynamics of Islam's spread from its geographical centre in Arabia to Asia, in both historical and contemporary contexts. Taking a border-crossing thematic approach, the course will cover the lands "across the Oxus river" (Transoxiana, or Mawarannahr), from Central Asia to Southeast Asia in a comparative manner, addressing themes relevant to both majority-Muslim settings and minority groups; in addition, students will be given windows to explore the fundamentals of Islam as a religious system as well as a historical phenomenon. Covered topics will include the emergence and consolidation of networks of knowledge and ritual, the relationship between localised practices and ideals of "orthodox purity", political visions of Islam, Islam and ethnicity, and others.
RELST2250;;;Introduction to Asian Religions;;;3;;;Winter, spring, summer.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;ASIAN2250;;;This course will explore religious traditions in South Asia (Pakistan, India, and Sri Lanka) and East Asia (China and Japan) including Hinduism, Buddhism (South Asian and East Asian), Sikhism, Confucianism, Daoism, and Shinto. We will also encounter a wide range of religious expressions, including myth, ritual, pilgrimage, mysticism, meditation, and other spiritual technologies.
RELST2255;;;Religion and Society in Asia;;;3;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ASIAN2255;;;The course aims to expose students to the varied landscape of religious realities in Asia offering an understanding of religion's development and interaction with Asia's society, culture, and politics. With no expectation of covering all religious traditions present in the region, the course will cover case-studies befitting the themes at hand, overall aiming at providing students with analytical tools to understand how the nexus between state, society, and religion affects contemporary Asia. Themes addressed in the course will include: religious diversity and pluralism, debates on religious freedoms, the impact of colonialism, secularization and its opponents, the shaping of national identities, issues of ethnicity and migration, and religion as a channel to express discontent.
RELST2299;;;Buddhism;;;3;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ASIAN2299;;;This course will explore the Buddhist tradition from its origins in ancient India to its migrations throughout Asia and eventually to the West. The first part of the course will deal with Indian Buddhism: the Buddha, the principal teachings and practices of his early followers, and new developments in spiritual orientation. We will then turn to the transmission of Buddhism to Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia, where at least one of the early schools has been preserved. Next we will look at Mahayana Buddhism as it moves north and east, encompassing China, Japan, and Tibet. While much of the course will be devoted to developments in traditional times, we will also look at some of the ways Buddhist cultures have responded to modernity.
RELST2575;;;Myth and Religion in Mesopotamia;;;3;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;JWST2575;NES2575;NES6575;;;This course will survey the cultic practices and beliefs of ancient Babylonia and Assyria, the two major civilizations of Mesopotamia. We will examine the major myths of this region, e.g., Ishtar's Descent into the Netherworld, Etana, and Gilgamesh, in light of what they reveal about Mesopotamian religion, politics, and understanding of the afterlife. We will also examine the performance of magical rituals and incantations, methods of predicting the future, and the role of sacred marriage, prostitution, and slavery in the ancient temple.
RELST2630;;;Religion and Reason;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(KCM-AS);;;;;;PHIL2530;;;In this course we will examine some of the major arguments regarding the existence and nature of a supreme being - ontological, cosmological, teleological, Pascalian, and moral arguments. We will also discuss the most significant argument against the existence of the classical God - namely, the argument from evil and suffering. After that, we will look at whether religious belief might be rational without theoretical proof or empirical evidence, whether religious experience is an intelligible notion, and whether the real-world fact of religious diversity has philosophical implications. Time permitting, we will conclude by reflecting on two prominent religious ideas: miracles and the afterlife. Course readings will be taken from both historical and contemporary sources.
RELST2634;;;Jews and the Classical Age of Islam;;;3;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;CLASS2634;COML2634;JWST2634;NES2634;;;This course examines the cultural and historical interaction of Muslims and Jews from the emergence of Islam in the seventh century through the classical age of Islam down to the turn of the thirteenth century. The intersection of the two cultures (scriptural, spiritual, intellectual, literary, communal, and interpersonal) and members of their respective religious communities will be studied through readings of primary texts (in translation). The course will conclude with some brief reflections on historical memory and the modern and contemporary significance of the two religious communities' interactions during the classical age of Islam.
RELST2644;;;Introduction to Judaism;;;3;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;JWST2644;NES2644;;;In this course, students will survey the development of Judaism from its roots in ancient Mesopotamia to modernity. Rather than thinking of Judaism as static and easily definable, we will explore a history that is complex and dynamic. Over the three thousand year period that we will be studying, individuals and groups who identified themselves as Israelites or Jews developed a remarkable variety of beliefs and practices in conversation and in competition with other groups, including Christianity and Islam. We will examine trends and key moments of this process in order to understand how continuity and change, the construction of identity, and the competition for legitimacy have shaped our contemporary ideas about what Judaism is. We will approach this subject from a historical perspective, analyzing material evidence and reading texts from each period in translation, and from a religious studies perspective, carefully observing how the meaning of categories such as religion and Judaism change over time. A better understanding of these changes can help us better to appreciate difference and conflict both ancient and contemporary.
RELST2695;;;Introduction to Christian History;;;3;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;CLASS2636;JWST2695;NES2695;;;This course offers an introduction to the history of Christianity from the first century through the seventeenth and perhaps a bit beyond. Our emphasis will be on the diversity of Christian traditions, beliefs, and practices throughout history. We will explore the origins of Christianity within the eastern Mediterranean world, the spread of Christianity, the development of ecclesiastical institutions, the rise and establishment of monasticism, and the various controversies that occupied the church throughout its history. Throughout the course, we will supplement our reading of primary texts with art, archaeology, music, and manuscripts.
RELST2724;;;Introduction to the Hebrew Bible;;;3;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;JWST2724;NES2724;;;The Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) is a repository of ancient Israelite religious, political, social, historical, and literary traditions. For the modern reader these ancient traditions are often obscured by a focus on the text as revelation. The purpose of this course is to introduce students to the biblical world by reading the Hebrew Bible in translation, on its own terms, as a body of literature that evolved in an ancient Near Eastern context. The Bible itself will be the primary text for the course, but students will also be exposed to the rich and diverse textual traditions of the ancient Near East, including Mesopotamia, Egypt, Moab, and Ugarit. In addition, this course will explore the impact of early biblical interpretation on shaping the monotheistic traditions inherited in the West. As participants in a secular course on the Bible, students will be challenged to question certain cultural assumptions about the composition and authorship of the Bible, and will be expected to differentiate between a text's content and its presumed meaning.
RELST2777;;;Introduction to Rabbinic Literature and History;;;3;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;CLASS2631;JWST2777;NES2777;;;This course offers an overview of Rabbinic Literature from the first century BCE through the eight century of the Common Era. Each class will combine broad historical background with the close reading of Rabbinic texts. We will not only try to understand what these texts say and how they say it but we will also explore how Rabbinic ideas and modes of expression compare to those with which we as modern readers are more familiar. We will begin with a survey of various forms of Bibli-cal and post-Biblical Second Temple writings. These texts will serve to establish the literary frameworks against which the rabbinic genres form. We will then explore the Mishanh, the Tosefta, and the Palestinian and Babylonian Talmuds. Through an exploration of the development of parallel themes, we will come to an understanding of how and when these texts evolved. Finally, we will explore a number of Midrashic compilations and assess their historical settings as well as their literary and ideological relationships to the two Talmuds. All Texts will be read in translation.
RELST3150;;;Medieval Philosophy;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(KCM-AS);;;;;;MEDVL3210;PHIL3210;;;A selective survey of Western philosophical thought from the fourth to the 14th century. Topics include the problem of universals, the theory of knowledge and truth, the nature of free choice and practical reasoning, and philosophical theology. Readings (in translation) include Augustine, Boethius, Anselm, Abelard, Aquinas, Scotus, and Ockham. Some attention will be given to the development of ideas across the period and the influence of non-Western traditions on the West.

We will consider its urban development from ancient polis to modern metropolis, its marvels of religious architecture from the Hagia Sophia to the Suleymaniye, the splendor of its residences from the Great Palace of the Byzantine Emperors to the Topkapi Sarayi, and the daily life of its humbler residents from the games of the Hippodrome to the taverns and brothels.
RELST3280;;;Literature of the Old Testament;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;COML3280;;;Analysis of small sections of well-known material for in-depth discussion.
RELST3309;;;Temple in the World: Buddhism in Contemporary South and Southeast Asia;;;3;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ASIAN3309;;;Buddhism is often thought of as a meditative and philosophical tradition, remote from the concerns and pleasures of everyday life, practical ethics, and politics. This course explores the unfolding of Buddhist life in contemporary South and Southeast Asia, in locations such as Burma, Thailand, India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, and Cambodia. We will see how the practices of meditation and philosophical reflection enter the lives of Buddhists, along with other expressions of devotion, aesthetic fascination, political action, and sociability. Our goal will be to recognize the sensual, emotional, and social qualities of Buddhist practice, and the ways in which life unfolds in a Buddhist idiom.
RELST3311;;;Ritual and Performance in Muslim Southeast Asia;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;Prerequisite: one course in the humanities.;;;ASIAN3311;ASIAN6611;NES3511;;;Structured as a seminar, this course addresses ritual performances as expressed by Muslim communities across Southeast Asia (in both minority and majority contexts), from performativity of the five pillars of Islam to special events related to the Prophet and his family, rites of passage, and shrine veneration, to name a few. The course does not require specific knowledge of Islam, nor familiarity with Arabic, as students will be introduced to the fundamentals of Islam as a religious system as well as a historical phenomenon through the exploration of rituality. Besides geographic variations across the region, themes will include the combination of performances hailing from multiple religious traditions; the existence of shared patterns of rituality between different religious traditions; the impact of transnational networks and the conversation between local and foreign vocabularies of rituality.
RELST3331;;;Gender and Sexuality in Southeast Asian Cinema;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;ASIAN3331;ASIAN6631;FGSS3331;FGSS6331;LGBT3331;LGBT6331;PMA3431;;;Examines the new cinemas of Southeast Asia and their engagement with contemporary discourses of gender and sexuality. It pays special attention to the ways in which sexuality and gendered embodiment are at present linked to citizenship and other forms of belonging and to how the films draw on Buddhist and Islamic traditions of representation and belief. Focusing on globally circulating Southeast Asian films of the past 15 years, the course draws on current writings from feminism, Buddhist studies, affect theory, queer studies, postcolonial theory, and film studies to ask what new understandings of subjectivity might emerge from these cinemas and their political contexts. Films will be drawn from both mainstream and independent cinema and will include the work of directors such as Apichatpong Weerasethakul, Danny and Oxide Pang, Yau Ching, Thunska Pansittivorakul, Garin Nugroho, and Jean-Jacques Annaud.
RELST3344;;;Introduction to Indian Philosophy;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(KCM-AS);;;;;;ASIAN3344;CLASS3674;;;This course will survey the rich and sophisticated tradition of Indian philosophical thought from its beginnings in the speculations of Upanishads, surveying debates between Hindus, Buddhists, Jains and materialistic philosophers about the existence and nature of God  and of the human soul, the nature of knowledge, and the theory of language.
RELST3353;;;Mysticism in Chinese Religion;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ASIAN3353;;;This course will examine techniques of spiritual cultivation in both the Daoist and Buddhist traditions of China. In particular we will compare and contrast methods which focus on the manipulation of bodily energies and fluids, particularly in the early and medieval Daoist traditions, with the Buddhist emphasis on cognitive transformation, particularly in the Chan school. Some of our discussion will also look at the debates on the nature of mystical states as "pure consciousness events" on the one hand, or culturally-specific constructions on the other.
RELST3367;;;Buddhism and its Religious Others in South and Southeast Asia;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ASIAN3367;;;This course examines how Buddhist identities, communities and self-understandings are constituted in part through moments of encounter with non-Buddhists. How do Buddhists respond to the challenge of incommensurable religious diversity? What social forces restrict or expand the horizons of intelligibility, tolerance and accommodation? Focusing on the modern era, we will explore missionary work and conversion, ritual and doctrinal borrowing, hybrid communities of religious belonging, interfaith and ecumenical dialogue, and politicized or violent inter-religious conflict. We will analyze how different Buddhist actors and institutions employ diverse strategies of boundary definition and negotiation in relation to various forms of religious distinction and difference. The goal is to understand how the communal, historical and religious self-understandings of Buddhists in contemporary South and Southeast Asia have been shaped by their complicated interactions with Christian, Hindu, Muslim, animist and other religious communities.
RELST3420;;;Myth, Ritual, and Symbol;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ANTHR3420;;;Examines how systems of thought, symbolic forms, and ritual practice are formulated and expressed in primarily non-Western societies. Focuses on anthropological interpretations of space, time, cosmology, myth, classificatory systems (e.g., color, totems, food, dress, kinship), taboos, sacrifice, witchcraft, sorcery, and rites of passage (birth, initiation, marriage, death). Examines both the roles of specialists (e.g., spirit mediums, curers, priests, ascetics) and nonspecialists in producing these cultural forms.
RELST3531;;;Daoist Traditions;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;ASIAN3332;CAPS3531;HIST3531;;;This course will examine the modes of philosophical and spiritual inquiry, varieties of spiritual/bodily cultivation and practice, and religious organizations and movements in China that we know as Daoist (or "Taoist"). We will review debates around the labeling of these ideas and practices. We will examine the ways in which Daoism was used to contest or legitimate imperial political power, and how the procedures and ideologies of the imperial state in turn informed Daoist theory and practice. Throughout, we will consider the ways in which standard modern western dichotomies, such as sacred/secular, spiritual/physical, and mind/body, break down when we try to apply them to the study of Daoism.
RELST3540;;;On Paying Attention;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;FREN3540;;;In the age of smartphones and Facebook, the competing claims made on our attention only seem to be multiplying. This course is an opportunity to think about and to enact certain practices of attentiveness and concentration, drawing largely from religious, literary, artistic, philosophical and anthropological sources. We'll be trying various kinds of exercises - from reading poems and looking at paintings to eating more slowly - as we read about the ways in which our seneses reach out to the world, and as we think together about how technology may be used in ways that are not, strictly speaking, technological. This course is for students at all levels, from all backgrounds, graduate and undergraduate, with the  understanding that we all need an excuse to slow down and observe the world - and ourselves - a little more carefully.

The focus will be on exploring the rich diversity of Christianity in late antiquity by reading a wide range of primary literary sources, including selections from the New Testament, church fathers, apocryphal writings, gnostic literatures, saints lives, and much more. In addition, we will study the material culture of early Christianity through archaeology, art, inscriptions, and papyri. Special attention will be given to the varieties of Christianity and the ways in which various forms of Christianity in different regions around the Mediterranean interfaced with paganism, Judaism, and Islam.

Departing from an analysis of forms of devotion towards the 'Alid members of prophet Muhammad's family (scriptures and ritual), class discussions will address issues such as constructions of sectarian identities (Sunni versus Shi'i), the role of transnational flows in shaping Shi'i communities across the region, Muslim-majority governments' reactions to the emergence of such communities, and broader debates on orthodoxy and 'deviation' (both within and between Islamic traditions). Although lectures at the beginning will cover the historical process by which Shi'i Islam came into shape, this will be pursued critically, and students are expected to have foundational knowledge of Islam's theology and history.
RELST4449;;;History and Methods of the Academic Study of Religion;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(KCM-AS);;;Prerequisite: two courses in religious studies or permission of instructor.;;;ASIAN4449;;;This course provides advanced students in Religious Studies or the humanities a working familiarity with important methodological issues in the academic study of religion. Following a brief historical outline of the development of the academic study of religion, we will survey major approaches to the academic study of religion currently used and discussed in Religious Studies today. We will read representative and seminal works from the following approaches to the study of religion: anthropology, philosophical hermeneutics, phenomenology, history of religions, the sociology of religion and critical ideological studies. For each of these cases, we will see how these studies both build upon the nineteenth century assumptions of the nature of religion and have addressed twentieth century religious and theoretical issues. For each of the texts we will be reading, we will try to grasp why particular approaches had the appeal they did when they did. The course operates as an intellectual history of the rise of the study of religion as an academic (as opposed to confessional) subject.
RELST4466;;;Religious Nationalism and Political Violence in South and Southeast Asia;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;Prerequisite: one course in ANTHR, ASIAN, HIST, RELST, at the 3000-level or above or permission of instructor.;;;ASIAN4466;ASIAN6666;RELST6666;;;This course examines how religious ideologies, practices and institutions have been politically mobilized in the public spheres of modern South and Southeast Asia. Divisive social conflict and communal violence have resulted from this mobilization, challenging conventional secular notions of national identity and political community. How have nationalist, developmental and democratic agendas in the post-colonial era contributed to the emergence of assertive, contentious religious identities? How have religious beliefs, communities, and historical memories been transformed by this mobilization? In what ways have these visions of religious nationalism transformed the political, economic and social dynamics of the post-colonial states of South and Southeast Asia? We will examine a variety of cases including Hindutva and communal violence in India, ethno-religious chauvinism and civil war in Sri Lanka, the Saffron Revolution and anti-Muslim campaigns in Burma, and religious insurgency in Thailand.
RELST4557;;;Desert Monasticism;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;CLASS4677;JWST4557;MEDVL4557;NES4557;;;How and why do landscapes come to inspire the religious imagination? And how do sensory landscapes, more specifically-territories of sight, sound, touch, taste, and smell-inform, inflect, and engage the religious imagination? When and why do religious practices, rituals, traditions, and beliefs inhabit particular landscapes? This seminar treats these questions by focusing on a particular landscape-the "desert," both imagined and real-as it has shaped religious ascetic practice. Biblical notions of howling desert wastelands and subsequent ideas about deserts inhabited by terrifying and grotesque demons; paradise, a garden where angels' wings whir and pure light shines; valleys of rattling dry bones, sinews, and skins that breathe with new life; heavens clanging with the sound of war between seven-headed dragons and angels; demons coming in the forms of roaring lions and hissing serpents-the religious imaginary is shaped in striking ways by sensory landscapes. We will read widely from desert Christian monastic literatures, mostly from late ancient Egypt, to explore both the historical development of monasticism in Christianity and examine why the monastic impulse seems so closely tied to the "desert." In addition to reading saints lives, we will read early monastic rules, the desert fathers, and we will draw from archaeological sources to examine the varieties of ascetic practices in the deserts of late ancient Egypt, Gaza, Sinai, Palestine, and Syria. Throughout the course we will explore ancient and modern ideas about "wilderness" and we will explore parallels between ancient Near Eastern literatures and their nineteenth- and twentieth-century parallels in the American frontier and environmental literatures.
RELST4618;;;Seminar in Early Islamic History: The Emergence of Islam: 600-750;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;HIST4614;NES4618;;;An examination of Islamic history from 600-750, with special attention to historiography and interpretive issues. Topics to be discussed will include: Arabia and the Near East before Islam; the collection of the Qur'an, the biography of Muhammad, the Arab conquests, the Umayyad caliphs, and the Abbasid takeover.
RELST4628;;;Gnosticism and Early Christianity;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;CLASS4636;JWST4628;NES4628;;;What is "Gnosticism" and why has it come to be so hotly debated among scholars and in our contemporary media? What is the Gospel of Judas and are its ideas "heretical"? Who wrote the Gospel of Thomas and the Gospel of Mary and why were these Gospels not included in the New Testament canon? To what extent did Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code draw from ancient Christian gnostic sources? This seminar will explore answers to these questions and many others by focusing on the complex array of literary sources from late antiquity-primarily from a cache of manuscripts found at Nag Hammadi, Egypt, in 1945-that have long been associated with a so-called "Christian Gnosticism." Church Fathers condemned the "movement" on a variety of grounds, but in this course we will not simply read the condemnations written by the opponents of gnostic thought; rather, we will focus our attention on reading (in English translation) substantial portions of the "gnostic" texts written by the adherents themselves. We will give special attention to the ways in which conflicts about Gnosticism connected with conflicts about gender, heresy, power, and authority. To set these texts within a socio-historical context, we will discuss the possible Jewish and hellenistic roots of early Christian Gnosticism and ties to Stoic and other ancient philosophical movements.
RELST4665;;;Augustine;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;CLASS4665;PHIL4210;;;Augustine's De Trinitate 10 argues that the mind is an immaterial substance that models in some respects the divine trinity.  This course will study Augustine's conception of the mind, focusing on his arguments for the mind's self-knowledge and their relation to Greek and Latin philosophical antecedents.
RELST4707;;;Writing Muslims: Literature and Film of Muslim Diaspora(s);;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;COML4601;ENGL4798;NES4707;;;How and where does-indeed, can-one write the story of a diaspora of the Muslim creative and critical imagination? Guided by the critical work of e.g. Hawley, Rushdie, and Subramani, we will read and watch the works of Leila Aboulela, Zulfikar Ghose, Abdulrazak Gurnah, Mohja Kahf, Sorayya Khan, Manzu Islam, Hanif Kureishi, Ian Iqbal Rashid and others. We will critique, evaluate, and enjoy these works through the lens of the diasporic condition, by paying special attention to the effects of displacement and its impact on articulations of faith, history, identity, memory, mythologies, nation(alism), subjugation, the postmodern, and the (post)postcolonial. All readings and films in English.
RELST4776;;;Talmud and the Art of Reading;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;CLASS4637;JWST4776;NES4776;;;The Babylonian Talmud has long been viewed as the central text of post-Biblical Judaism.  Yet little is known about who wrote it and when it was written.  Since the Talmud is an extremely difficult text to master, its readership has therefore until recently been limited to few expert traditional scholars.  Over the past fifty or so years, with the advent of translations and study guides, the Talmud has gained increasing popularity. The Talmud has long been viewed as a source for history, law, or moral lessons. But literature interacts with the cultures that produce and read it in far more nuanced and significant ways. In the past century, advances in theories of how and why to read literature have opened up new avenues for understanding what the Talmud says and, more importantly, how it works . This course will examine provocative, bizarre, and salacious Talmud passages through the lens of the evolution of the major theoretical schools of the past century. Each week we will explore a theoretical movement ( e.g. New Criticism, Formalism, Post-Stucturalism, Feminist Criticism, New Historicism , etc .) and apply their reading strategies to close readings of Talmud passages.  We will simultaneously read the work of modern Talmud scholars whose reading practices align with each of these theoretical schools.  All Texts will be read in translation and no previous knowledge of Talmud or Critical Theory is necessary.
RELST4825;;;Change in Late Antiquity;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;CLASS4625;CLASS6625;HIST4825;HIST6825;;;In the fourth century C.E. the Roman emperors decided to favor Christianity and shortly thereafter to forbid non-Christian activity. The 'end of paganism' however did not occur all at once if it ever did. This seminar will focus on the approaches to the problem of Christianization and on its documentation. Through readings and discussion, we will chart the transformations of the Roman world from 250 to 600 C.E.

RELST6707;;;The Literature and Film of Muslims and Others in Diaspora;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;COML6724;NES6707;;;Together we explore how contemporary diasporic Muslim, Latin American, European and Asian writers and filmmakers operate with(in) memory, with the impossible longing to belong, with the loss of 'home' (when 'home' is where they already are?) We will read and plumb Zulfikar Ghose, Abdulrazak Gurnah, Sorayya Khan, Manzu Islam and Hanif Kureishi; and we will watch 'My Beautiful Laundrette,' 'Surviving Sabu' and 'Le Grand voyage'. Participants will be invited to each contribute one primary reading or viewing to the seminar. To sharpen our critical lenses-viz. the diasporic condition, identity, memory, gender and mythology-we will be guided by Ahmed, Erickson, Hawley, Rushdie, and Subramani. Together we will try to understand how the expatriate, the im/migrant, the emigre, writes herself, her world, and her condition. Most material in English.

ROMS3210;;;History of Romance Languages I;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;Prerequisite: A 2000-level (or higher) course in any Romance language, and some familiarity with a second one or with Latin.;;;LING3321;;;The Romance languages are the lasting imprint of all that happened to the Latin language as it moved through time, territories, and people of many ethnicities.  While the Latin of antiquity retained its prestige in high culture, the natural untutored usage of ordinary people was always free to go its own way.  This course covers the following topics, selected to create a panoramic view:  Formation of the general Romance seven-vowel system from Latin.  Early and widespread sound changes in popular Latin.  Finding and interpreting evidence for trends in popular Latin pronunciation.  The comparative method and its limitations.  Essential later sound changes, some of which ceate a whole new order of consonants unknown to Latin but conspicuous in Romance.  Nouns and adjectives from Latin to Romance.  Formation of the present indicative: the competing forces of sound change and analogical adjustment.  A brief overview of Portuguese.  Variants of the seven-vowel system.  Salient features of Romanian.  Factors that helped shape the vocabulary of Romance.  Medieval diglossia.  Emergence of Romance vernaculars newly recognized by their speakers as languages distinct from Latin and from each other.  Close analysis of the oldest surviving document written unmistakably in Romance (842 C. E.).
ROMS3220;;;History of Romance Languages II;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;Prerequisite: ROMS 3210, or permission of instructor.;;;LING3322;;;Further study of historical developments in the Romance languages will be interleaved with readings of significant Romance texts from the 9th to 13th centuries, both notarial and literary. Topics covered include: More on medieval diglossia and scribal practices. How medieval glosses bear on the study of early Romance. Losses and innovation in the Romance lexicon. Formation of three high-frequency irregular verbs: be, have, and go. Raising and yod effects in Spanish and Italian, yod metathesis in French. Verb morphology from Latin to Romance with emphasis on the synthetic past, the periphrastic past and future, newly created past participles, and the conditional mood. Students will become acquainted with the resources for studying medieval documents and produce an annotated translation of an excerpt from a pre-1400 Romance text as a final project.
ROMS3490;;;Literature and Moral Complexity;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;COML3531;FREN3490;ITAL3490;;;In this course, we will ask how literature helps us to formulate ethical questions, i.e., question for which there is no single, objectively correct answer.  Why literature as opposed to philosophy or history?  Numerous aspects of literture make it ideal for taking on complex ethical questions.  Literture can be used to persuade or even manipulate; it appeals to our emotions as well as our reason, and may even call into question the neat division between the two; it forges sympathies that tie us as readers to characters and narrators, even as we suspect their motives.  For most of our time together, we will focus on great writers and storytellers of early modern Europe (e.g., Boccaccio, Machiavelli, Montaigne, Marguerite de Navarre, Bandello), but we will also explore how ethical questions posed by these early modern writers continue to surface in the work of an author like Barbey D'Aurevilly and in a contemporary movie such as Stephen Spielberg's Lincoln. If there is student interest, we will offer discussion sections in French and Italian.
ROMS3620;;;Culture of the Later Renaissance;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ARTH3420;COML3620;FREN3620;RELST3620;;;This course explores networks of culture and power that develop over the course of the sixteenth century, from the beginning of the Reformation to the Wars of Religion that swept through the continent.  We will examine this period through the lenses of several disciplines: history, history of science, art history, literature, music.  Guest lecturers will include professors from all of these fields, and authors and artists to be studied will include: Luther, Marguerite de Navarre, Michelangelo, Ambroise Pare, Shakespeare, and Monteverdi.
ROMS4176;;;Still Life: Animals, Technology, Representation;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;COML4176;VISST4176;;;The language of "capture" left hunting and military idioms at the end of the 19th century to pervade today's aesthetic, scientific, technological and critical lexicons. This course examines how this leap from the literal to the metaphorical signaled a sea change in the representation of animal life. Looking at an array of literary, artistic and philosophical texts, the course surveys key contributions to thinking through how mechanized technologies of capture (microscopes, photography, cinema, microphones, etc.) informed and transformed our modern conceptions of subjectivity and objectivity, art and non-art, reality and virtuality, life and death, the animal and the human. Authors may include Flaubert, Poe, Welty, Muybridge, Marey, von Uexkull, Benjamin, Deleuze and Guattari, Herzog, Crary, Chow, Ranciere, Haraway.
ROMS4230;;;Perspectives in Intellectual History: Modernity, Cataclysm and the Jews (1880-1930);;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;GERST4231;GERST6231;HIST4232;HIST6232;JWST4230;JWST6230;ROMS6230;;;Between the end of the nineteenth century and the second World War, the Jewish intellectual appears as a new figure of European societies, quickly becoming a major actor in public spheres.  During those years, the Jewish intellectual becomes a privileged object of investigations, definitions and fantasies -- including anti-Semitic stereotypes -- for literature and popular culture, sociology and medicine or law, deeply shaping national mentalities and imagination.  A considerable iconography, from painting to political propaganda and illustrated magazines, sketches his real or invented profile.  As an incarnation of urbanity, mobility, extraterritoriality, textuality and rational thought, the Jewish intellectual turns out to be a mirror of modernity, eliciting a strong conservative rejection.  Lasting from the Dreyfus Affair to the Nazi burning of books in 1933, and focusing on three national contexts -- France, Germany and Italy -- the course tries to explore the history of this collective representation through its multiple expressions, both textual and visual.

It is during those years, nevertheless, that the destruction of European Jews aroused an intellectual debate whose philosophical, political, and literary contributions constitute landmarks for contemporary culture and criticism.  The course will explore the reasons for such a discrepancy, reconstructing the steps of the integration of the Holocaust into our historical consciousness.  It will analyze some of the most significant attempts to think such a trauma made by German-Jewish exiles (Arendt, Adorno, Anders), the survivors of the Nazi camps (Amery, Levi, Celan, Antelme), as well as the public intellectuals on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean (Sartre, Bataille, MacDonald, etc).

Its ideas, debates and controversies could be viewed-historicized and revisited-in a different light.  The defeated revolutions of the past century put into question a teleological vision of history, engendering the decline of Marxist historiography and the simultaneous appearance of memory, a previously ignored concept for interpreting the past.  Outlining a symbolic shift from Marx to Benjamin, this change has a melancholic flavor that permeates many expressions of contemporary Left culture (from movies and autobiographies to historical and philosophical essays).  On the other hand, the emergence of Postcolonialism reopened the debate on the Eurocentric roots of Marx's thought and stimulated a new approach to some classical Marxist thinkers and historians such as Gramsci and C.L.R. James.  Taking into account both classical and contemporary texts, the seminar will analyze a reconfigured relationship between history and memory in the Left culture of our post-utopian age.
ROMS4550;;;The "European Civil War": Violence, Politics and Culture in Europe (1914-1945);;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;;;;At the end of the Great War, Europe became the realm of a new relationship among violence, culture, and politics. From 1914-1945, the continent witnessed an extraordinary entanglement of inter-state wars, revolutions and counter-revolutions, civil wars and genocides.  Originating as a classical inter-state conflict, the Great War led to a Weltanschaungskrieg. In spite of its highly controversial uses, the concept of "European Civil War" is probably the must useful in order to sum up such an "age of  extremes" in which wars have no rules: they become wars against civilians, politics makes groups into implacable enemies and an endemic violence deeply reshaped both cultures and collective imagination. This course will analyze some features of this cataclysmic time by engaging political theory, cultural and intellectual history.
ROMS4944;;;Biopolitics;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;COML4944;COML6944;ROMS6944;;;This course explores the philosophical concept of biopolitics and its diverse translations and/or adaptations across multiple disciplines and across the globe (Africa, Far East, South East Asia, and the Americas). We will trace the concept of biopolitics and its attendant notions-Biopower, Sovereignty, Governmentality-as they emerge in the work of Michel Foucault and analyze the multiple disciplinary and geographical directions in which they have travelled. Throughout the semester, we shall examine 1. the innovative thinking around biopolitics in the works of Arendt, Esposito, Agamben, Hardt and Negri, 2. the connections and entanglements of the concept with postcolonial theory in Mbembe, Samaddar, Sakai, Mezzadra, 3. the extension and complication of biopolitical logistics over to non-human bodies in Uexkull, Sloterdijk, Wolfe, Shukin. Additionally, we will examine theorizations of new stylistics of power as well as emerging forms of agency and political organizing in the biopolitical sphere. Key terms include race, postcoloniality, animality, capture, embodiment, agency, technology.

SHUM4876;;;Humanitarian Affects;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;ANTHR4176;FGSS4876;GOVT4745;;;Liberal feminists and political theorists argue that sentiments such as compassion and empathy have the capacity to alert us to suffering, injustice, and oppression, and thus incite transformative political action. This interdisciplinary seminar explores the challenges to this theory by staging a conversation between postcolonial, feminist, and queer theories of affect, and anthropological critiques of humanitarian projects. Sentiments are mobilized to defend borders, wage wars, grant asylum to refugees, provide medical care and disaster relief, and inspire feminist activism. We will analyze how these gendered and racialized ethical projects and political regimes are co-constituted, and how they mediate access to resources and survival, as well as political agency, subjectivity, citizenship, and national belonging.
SHUM4990;;;Sense and Citizenship: Aesthetics in Political Theory;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;COML4025;GOVT4666;;;In this seminar, we will inquire into how questions of sensation cross between literature, aesthetics and political theory. Drawing from writings in continental philosophy and phenomenology, the challenge of the class will be to inquire into how sensation in particular broadens notions of citizenship and politics. How do accounts of sensation in political theory reconceive citizenship? What are possible conceptual practices for unraveling normative, colonial, and authoritarian definitions of the political subject? What is the place of sensation in theories of relationality? Students will also be asked to critique the terms under which citizenship is constrained, defined, and regulated. In addition, the course will examine how accounts of sensation delineate traces and figures excluded from the rights conferred by organized polities. In order to account for those excluded from citizenship, the seminar will also consider the role of sight, touch, and imagination in the public realm or, as Hannah Arendt writes, "namely, the faculty of seeing things not only from one's own perspective but from that of all others who are present." Facing the challenge of Arendt's words, the course will reflect on the implications of critique, judgment, and phenomenology for democratic theory in general. Discussions may, for example, seek to uncouple the rhetoric of sovereignty and law from citizenship. Finally, we will ask what a study of sensation provides for redressing and/or accounting for dispossession. As students will be encouraged to integrate their research interests with course reading, topics may include questions of how philosophies of anarchism, civil disobedience, feminism, queer theory, and decolonization broaden ideas of citizenship and political ethics.
SHUM4991;;;Romanticism and the Fate of the Senses;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;COML4019;ENGL4491;STS4981;;;What if, William Blake once asked, every bird that flies "is an immense world of delight, closed by your senses five?" Asking what real and possible worlds our habits of sensory perception exclude, Romantic poets criticized their culture's increasing faith in sense-based, empirical knowledge - knowledge supposedly free from subjective bias, historical circumstance, national prejudice, and political complicity. This seminar will focus on poetry as a form of sensory re-training and on Romantic and post-Romantic claims to a politics of perception. Can artworks access rival science, non-human experience, or otherwise unthinkable histories - or sensually suspend the pressure to do so? Readings from Blake, Keats, Dickinson, Goethe, Locke, Foucault, Latour, Daston, Ranciere, Bourdieu, Williams, de Man, Adorno, Terada, Stewart, and Hartman.
SHUM4992;;;Affective Ecologies;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;COML4026;ENGL4992;FGSS4992;LGBT4992;;;This seminar considers the points of intersection between theories of affect, emotion, and sexuality in recent queer and feminist thought, and the set of critical and cultural developments that has come to be called the "nonhuman turn." We will explore contemporary critical attention to the agential, sensory and cognitive capacities of the non-human, considering how this body of work reconfigures the relations between human and nonhuman worlds, and the more flexible and nuanced accounts of "nature" and "environments" that they make possible. At the same time, we will examine how the radically expanded ethos of being-in-common proposed by the non-human turn operates alongside the structures and histories of dehumanization to which and feminist, queer and critical race theory have drawn our attention.
SHUM4993;;;U.S. Pop Music and Racial Common Sense;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;AMST4990;MUSIC4333;PMA4964;;;This course brings together the fields of sound, popular music, and performance studies in order to investigate how "racial common sense" has been constituted at various moments in U.S. cultural history. Through the central trope of the "sensing body," this course draws from interdisciplinary analytics-listening, voice, audio-vision, accent, soundtrack, to name a few-in order to investigate the role of popular music and performance in how race has been naturalized. This course pays particular attention to the relationship between live performances and the various recording and media technologies that have impacted a longer U.S. cultural history: the phonograph, radio, microphones, film soundtracks, television, YouTube, critical and creative writing. Course assignments include: short reading and listening responses, album/performance reviews, an annotated bibliography/discography, group blog project, and final research paper.
SHUM4994;;;Archiving Sensation;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;COML4027;ENGL4994;FGSS4994;LGBT4994;;;This course will address the 2014-15 Society for Humanities theme of "sensation" through questions of method, focusing in particular on the interdisciplinary challenges of documenting and archiving sensation. Areas of focus will include: theory and practice of the archive from both queer studies and postcolonial studies; intersections of queer theory and affect theory that explore non-normative experiences of sensation, attachment, and intimacy; questions of genre and media, with particular emphasis on the limits and possibilities of "writing" sensation as opposed to representing it in other media, especially experimental and new media practices such as performance and art installation that are more explicitly embodied and/or material.
SHUM4995;;;Sensory Power, Sensory Subjects;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;The course will focus the notions of ''sensory power'' and ''politics of sensation'' through the analysis of contemporary forms of biopolitical governmentality in western democracies.The ethical-aesthetical governmental dispositiv implemented in Italy by Silvio Berlusconi's mass-mediatic populism will be used as a case-study, with specific regard to Berlusconi's sexual politics, as emerged in a sequence of sexual scandals between 2009 and 2011, and to its consequences on the heteronormative redefinition of gender roles. 
SHUM4996;;;Perfection, Objectivity and Sensation in Philosophy of Art;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;CLASS4604;GERST4996;PHIL4596;VISST4996;;;A graduate level discussion of the role of sensation in philosophy of art, and its relation to conceptions of objectivity and perfection. We'll aim to transform our understanding of a range of issues raised within traditional philosophy of art (for example, in the work of Plato, Aristotle, Aquinas, Hume, Kant, Nietzsche and Heidegger) by drawing upon relevant contemporary approaches in metaphysics, theory of knowledge and philosophy of mind.
SHUM4997;;;Pygmalion: Aesthetics of Touch;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;ARTH4956;CLASS4602;VISST4956;;;"Please Do Not Touch" is one of the signs we are most accustomed to seeing in art museums, yet the very need to make this request demonstrates how objects often invite, seek, even demand that we transgress the limits of vision and engage with them physically. In the Pygmalion myth, the artist's creating hand and the viewer's desire to touch come together in a fantasy of union with the object that has been endlessly appropriated and reimagined in later Western culture. Focusing on Classical art, this course explores the role of touch and embodiment in the viewing and reception of art objects, drawing on ancient models of sense-perception as well as 20th Century theorists such as Reigl, Berenson and Merleau-Ponty.  
SHUM4998;;;Feeling in Sound: Touch and the New Musical Body;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;COML4029;MUSIC4334;;;This seminar explores musical, aesthetic, physiological, and mythical  concepts associated with 'touch' in music. Focusing on the relationship between the hand of the musician and musical sound, we will develop an interdisciplinary history of musical touch, especially at the keyboard, from the late 18th century to the present. The four interrelated units focus on: 1) the clavichord and 18th-century concepts of sympathetic vibration; 2) the glass harmonica and physiology of the nervous system; 3) technologies of touch in the 19th century and the disciplining of the hand; and 4) the absent or fantastic touch and its relation to music-making at early 20th-century electronic instruments. We'll study musical, literary and visual texts, including works by C. P. E. Bach, Diderot, Chopin, Schumann, Coleridge, Canetti.  
SHUM4999;;;Transformations of Sense and Early Modern Thought;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;CLASS4999;COML4028;ENGL4999;;;This seminar investigates concepts of sensation in classical and early modern literature and philosophy, with a particular focus on 16th and 17th century writers. On the one hand, changing ideas of sensation may reflect significant shifts in western histories of physiology and selfhood, and the seminar will attend to these familiar themes. But on the other hand, the topic of sensation suggests ways of reading classical and early modern literature as transhistorical works of art, following Deleuze and Guattari's claim that "Art thinks no less than philosophy, but it thinks through affects and percepts" that form "compounds of sensations." We'll focus on the interweaving of sensation with physiology and environment, through attention to Metamorphosis, Humoral Embodiment, and Darkness. Readings include Aristotle, Ovid, Seneca, Shakespeare, Spenser, Milton, Hobbes, Descartes, Spinoza, Deleuze &amp; Guattari, Foucault, Heidegger, and Cassirer.

SOC1101;;;Introduction to Sociology;;;3;;;Fall, spring, summer.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;;;;This course introduces classical and contemporary sociological perspectives.  We will begin by considering (mainly classical) perspectives which focus on macro-level features of society (e.g., population, the economy) and the sweeping changes that have occurred within them over the past couple of centuries.  Particular attention will be paid to changes in social cohesion, the division of labor, the spatial organization of society, and technology. These theories, which are covered in the first two segments of the course, provide some insight into where society is going and what challenges have emerged along the way.  In the third segment of the course, we will look more closely at the role of individuals and everyday interaction in the genesis of social phenomena.  We will explore theories about what motivates individuals' social behavior, the role of rationality and emotion, how the micromechanics of interpersonal contact can shape larger society, and the subtle links between biological and social processes.  In the final segment of the course, we will explore complex webs that emerge through social actors' connections to each other, and how these network structures have been shaped by the various processes that were examined during the semester.
SOC2090;;;Networks;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;CS2850;ECON2040;INFO2040;;;This interdisciplinary course examines network structures and how they matter in everyday life. The course examines how each of the computing, economic, sociological and natural worlds are connected and how the structure of these connections affects each of these worlds. Tools of graph theory and game theory are taught and then used to analyze networks. Topics covered include the web, the small world phenomenon, markets, neural networks, contagion, search and the evolution of networks.
SOC2100;;;What Is Science? An Introduction to the Social Studies of Science and Technology;;;3-4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;STS2011;;;Introduces some of the central ideas in the field of S&amp;TS. As well as serving as an introduction to students who plan to major in Biology and Society or in Science and Technology Studies, the course is aimed at students with backgrounds in either the sciences or the humanities who are challenged to think more critically about what we mean by science, what counts as scientific knowledge and why, and how science and technology intervene in the wider world. The course is a mixture of lecture, discussion, and other activities. The discussion sections are an integral part of the course and attendance is required. In addition, a series of written assignments throughout the semester and a take-home final during exam week compose the majority of the grade.
SOC2190;;;Introduction to Economic Sociology;;;3;;;Spring.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;;;;What is the driving force behind economic growth? How do people find jobs? Does culture matter for economic action? What exactly is a market? Why is there a concentration of high-tech firms in Silicon Valley? Why has entrepreneurial capitalism emerged in China? These are some of the questions that this course will explore through the theoretical lens of economic sociology. Economic sociology has sought to understand the beliefs, norms, and institutions that shape and drive the global economy. It has sought to extend the sociological approach to the study of economic life by studying the interactions between social structure and economic action. The systematic application of sociological reasoning to explain economic action involves analysis of the ways in which social networks, norms, and institutions matter in economic transactions. The goal of this course is to provide an introduction to economic sociology as an approach and research program to understand and explain the relationship between economy and society in the modern era.
SOC2202;;;Population Dynamics;;;3;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;DSOC2010;;;Introduction to population studies. The primary focus is on the relationships between demographic processes (fertility, mortality, and immigration) and social and economic issues.

SOC2206;;;International Development;;;3-4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;DSOC2050;SOC2206;DSOC2050;SOC2206;;;International development concerns the gains, losses and tensions associated with the process of social change - as it affects human populations, social institutions and the environment. This course considers development as an evolving world project and from the perspective of its social and ecological impact: asking questions about costs and benefits of economic growth, about the global context (geo-political, institutional, production, consumption, and discursive relations), and the sustainability of various models. We relate development trends in the South/Third World with those in the North/First World. We also examine shared, global issues, such as the environment, human rights, security, and their condition in different parts of the world. In examining development historically, we encourage students to situate trends shaping the twenty-first century world, and how they can contribute, as global citizens, to the ongoing debate about how to reformulate development as an inclusive an empowering social process. This course combines Lectures with discussion, and uses films and section discussions to promote reflection on diversity of cultures and understandings of human development. It also includes a special component (access by instructor permission), in conjunction with Cornell's Writing in the Majors Program. This is worth an additional credit hour, and is for advanced students. These students will meet additionally in weekly Sections with a Writing Instructor from Development Sociology for a special topic focus to enhance understanding of course material as well as writing skills.
SOC2208;;;Social Inequality;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;DSOC2090;;;This course reviews contemporary approaches to understanding social inequality and the processes by which it comes to be seen as legitimate, natural, or desirable.  We address questions of the following kind:  What are the major forms of stratification in human history?  Are inequality and poverty inevitable?  How many social classes are there in advanced industrialism societies?  Is there a "ruling class?"  Are lifestyles, attitudes, and personalities shaped fundamentally by class membership?  Can individuals born into poverty readily escape their class origins and move upward in the class structure?  Are social contacts and "luck" important forces in matching individuals to jobs and class positions?  What types of social processes serve to maintain and alter racial, ethnic, and gender discrimination in labor markets?  Is there an "underclass?"  These and other questions are addressed in light of classical and contemporary theory and research.
SOC2220;;;Controversies About Inequality;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;DSOC2220;GOVT2225;ILROB2220;PAM2220;PHIL1950;;;In recent years, poverty and inequality have become increasingly common topics of public debate, as academics, journalists, and politicians attempt to come to terms with growing income inequality, with the increasing visibility of inter-country differences in wealth and income, and with the persistence of racial, ethnic, and gender stratification. This course introduces students to ongoing social scientific debates about the sources and consequences of inequality, as well as the types of public policy that might appropriately be pursued to reduce (or increase) inequality. These topics will be addressed in related unites, some of which include guest lectures by faculty from other universities (funded by the Center for the Study of Inequality). Each unit culminates with a highly spirited class discussion and debate.

Specifically, the course deals with the history of drug use and regulatory attempts in the United States and around the world; the relationship between drug use and racism/class conflict; pharmacology and use patterns related to specific drugs; perspectives on the etiology of drug use/abuse; AIDS prevention and harm reduction interventions; drug-using subcultures; drug policy, drug legislation, and drug enforcement; and the promotion and condemnation of drug activities in the mass media.
SOC2510;;;Social Gerontology: Aging and the Life Course;;;3;;;Spring.;;;(SBA-AS);;;Prerequisite: HD 1150, HD 1170, SOC 1101, DSOC 1101, or PSYCH 1101.;;;HD2510;;;Analyzes the social aspects of aging in contemporary American society from a lifecourse perspective. Topics include (1) an introduction to the field of gerontology, its history, theories, and research methods; (2) a brief overview of the physiological and psychological changes that accompany aging; (3) an analysis of the contexts (e.g., family, friends, social support, employment, volunteer work) in which individual aging occurs, including differences of gender, ethnicity, and social class; and (4) the influences of society on the aging individual.
SOC2520;;;Obama and the Meaning of Race;;;3;;;;;;;;;;;;ASRC2504;GOVT2604;;;The election of Barack Obama to the presidency has raised new questions in the American debate on race, politics, and social science. Has America entered a post-racial society in which racism and inequality are things of the past? Or does Obama's post-Black, race-neutral approach to governing signal the end of Black politics, race-based activism and prescriptive policy? In this course, students will use the Obama presidency to think, talk, and write about how race works in America. We'll examine the symbolism of Obama's personal narrative and biracialism to analyze his race-neutral campaigns and governing within the context of history, politics, and policies. We'll look at the public image of Michelle Obama, especially how she is gendered as Black radical and fashionista.
SOC2560;;;Sociology of Law;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;;;;This course provides an introduction to the sociological perspective of law and legal institutions in modern society. A key question is the extent to which the law creates and maintains social order. And, what is its role in social change? We will review theoretical perspectives on the reciprocal relationship between law and society, and consider how this relationship is reflected in contemporary legal issues. Empirical research covered in this course will examine social interactions among actors within legal institutions (including the criminal courts, law school classrooms, and the jury room), and how individuals experience and utilize the law in everyday life.
SOC2580;;;Six Pretty Good Books: Explorations in Social Science;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;COMM2580;HD2580;ILRLR2580;;;Intended for entering students and is organized around books rather than topics. The goal is to provide entering students with a foundational course in the integrative social sciences. It will be co-taught every fall by professors from two or more disciplines within the social sciences, thus providing a cross-disciplinary perspective, focusing on disciplinary similarities, and differences in constructs, assumptions, values, and methods, that social scientists employ when analyzing findings and arguments. This course is also designated as a University Course.  Please visit blogs.cornell.edu/universitycourses/ for further information.
SOC2650;;;Latinos in the United States;;;3-4;;;Spring.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;AMST2655;DSOC2650;LSP2010;;;Exploration and analysis of the Hispanic experience in the United States. Examines the sociohistorical background and economic, psychological, and political factors that converge to shape a Latino group identity in the United States. Perspectives are suggested and developed for understanding Hispanic migrations, the plight of Latinos in urban and rural areas, and the unique problems faced by the diverse Latino groups. Groups studied include Mexican Americans, Dominicans, Cubans, and Puerto Ricans.
SOC2710;;;Social and Political Context of American Education;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;AMST2710;AMST5710;DSOC2710;DSOC5710;EDUC2710;EDUC5710;SOC5710;;;This course is a blending of the Sociology of Education and Public Policy. Front and center in this course is the question of why consistent differential educational and economic outcomes exists in American society. We explore the broad sociological functions of schooling (socialization, sorting, caretaking, training) as well as local, state, and federal policies and court decisions.
SOC2930;;;Equality, Liberty, and Democracy;;;4;;;;;;;;;;;;GOVT2935;PHIL1930;;;An interdisciplinary discussion of economic inequality, civil, political and economic liberty and democracy. Some specific questions that we will consider are: In what ways and to what extent are Americans economically unequal? What are the major causes of American inequality and poverty? To what extent should inequality and poverty be changed by political means?  How should governments deal with religious diversity and other differences in ultimate values, which give rise, for example, to radically different attitudes toward abortion, sexuality, and the preservation of unspoiled nature?  Moral argument, empirical findings and theories of social causes interact in the search for answers to these questions. Our readings will derive from many disciplines and areas of public life, including political philosophy, sociology, economics, and political science.
SOC3010;;;Evaluating Statistical Evidence;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(MQR);;;;;;;;;This course will introduce students to the theory and mathematics of statistical analysis. Many decisions made by ourselves and others around us are based on statistics, yet few people have a solid grip on the strengths and limitations of these techniques. This course will provide a firm foundation for statistical reasoning and logical inference using probability. While there is math in this course, it is not a math class per se, as a considerable amount of attention is devoted to interpreting statistics as well as calculating them.
SOC3120;;;Urban Sociology;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;;;;The discipline of sociology arose, in large part, as a response to the rapid urbanization and industrialization of society. This course will begin with a brief history of urbanization, followed by consideration of central theories of urban sociology including ecological, political/economic, cultural, and experiential viewpoints. Next, we will examine more recent research to explore how individuals, social interactions, and institutions shape -- and are shaped by - characteristics of urban space. We will address topics such as urban poverty, race and ethnicity, residential segregation, housing, neighborhood context, crime and victimization, health, social isolation, culture, and global cities.
SOC3130;;;Sociology of Medicine;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;BSOC3111;DSOC3111;STS3111;;;This course provides an introduction to the ways in which medical practice, the medical profession, and medical technology are embedded in society and culture. We will ask how medicine is connected to various sociocultural factors such as gender, social class, race, and administrative cultures. We will examine the rise of medical sociology as a discipline, the professionalization of medicine, and processes of medicalization and demedicalization. We will look at alternative medical practices and how they differ from and converge with the dominant medical paradigm. We will focus on the rise of medical technology in clinical practice with a special emphases on reproductive technologies. We will focus on the body as a site for medical knowledge, including the medicalization of sex differences, the effect of culture on nutrition, and eating disorders such as obesity and anorexia nervosa. We will also read various classic and contemporary texts that speak to the illness experience and the culture of surgeons, hospitals, and patients, and we will discuss various case studies in the social construction of physical and mental illness.
SOC3150;;;Research Design, Practice, and Policy;;;3;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;PAM3120;;;Examines systematic approaches for addressing questions about poverty, family life, racial inequality, and a range of other issues central to public policy. It emphasizes the logic and methods of social science research, including the measurement of social phenomena, generalizing results to groups of interest, establishing cause and effect, social experiments, survey research, and qualitative methods. It develops skills to critically evaluate the research of others and provides hands-on experience applying research methods to policy-related problems.
SOC3190;;;Contemporary Sociological Theory;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;;;;Introduction to the main ideas and lines of research in contemporary sociology, from the emergence of the field in the American academy to the present. We read the work of seminal theorists and researchers such as Robert Merton, Erving Goffman, James Coleman, Harrison White, and Theda Skocpol. Topics include the development of distinctive lines of argument in areas like the study of the face-to-face group, the modern organization, social movements and social revolutions, inequality, and social mobility. The course considers the relationship between intellectual challenges, techniques of social inquiry, and the social context within which ideas are put forward and take hold.
SOC3240;;;Environment, Society, and Land;;;3;;;Spring.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;DSOC3240;STS3241;;;The purpose of this course is to provide a critical understanding of the interconnectedness of environment and society. A primary focus of the course will be the relationship between environmental and social problems as well as the many political ideologies, philosophies, and movements that have continually redefined how we think of environment and sustainability. By discussing issues of science and technology, popular culture, economics, urbanization, environmental change, racial and gender relations, and social movements, this course will reach a broad understanding of environmental issues. Throughout our exploration of environmental issues we will examine how environmental outcomes, at the local, as well as the global level are affected by (and affect) social inequality, power, community, and knowledge.
SOC3360;;;Evolving Families: Challenges to Public Policy;;;3;;;Fall.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;PAM3360;;;Examines the social institution of the family, challenges to the institution's well-being and stability, and the role of public policy in these transformations. Topics include family structure and responsibilities; marriage as a traditional building block of the family and challenges to the institution of marriage, including divorce, nonmarital childbearing, cohabitation, and same-sex unions; children, and the impact of family change on their wellbeing, including the effects of child poverty, maternal employment, and paternal involvement. The role of public policy in managing and shaping these developments is discussed.
SOC3370;;;Race and Public Policy;;;3;;;Spring.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;PAM3370;;;Provides an overview of perspectives used in sociological studies of race and ethnicity. Students read classic and contemporary research on racial and ethnic relations in the United States. The first part of the course covers a variety of theories on race/ethnic relations and addresses issues related to the social construction of race, racial identities, and the impact of immigration on racial dynamics. Next, the course examines racial and ethnic inequality in social and demographic outcomes. It concludes with readings that explore interracial contact and multiracial populations.
SOC3380;;;Urban Inequality;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;AMST3380;;;This is a seminar course on urban inequality in the United States.  The first half of the semester will be dedicated to understanding the political, historical, and social determinants of inequality in America's cities. Politically and socially, cities face unique challenges. Municipalities lack much formal authority to resolve issues that arise within their borders, and their populations are highly heterogeneous in terms of ethnicity, race, and social class. In the second half of the course, we will investigate a number of contemporary facets of urban inequality in-depth, such as residential segregation, urban schooling, immigration, and suburban sprawl.
SOC3420;;;Contested Terrain: Hawaii;;;3;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;Prerequisite: introductory or intermediate-level social sciences or history.;;;AIS3400;;;This course, offered through Earth and Atmospheric Sciences' program in Hawaii, draws from the fields of history, political science, and sociology to present an historical understanding of contemporary Hawaiian society. Topics include Western contact, establishment of Western institutions, overthrow of a sovereign government, annexation, and integration into the United States. Direct experience with Hawaiian leaders and institutions are incorporated to address contemporary issues: sovereignty, economic development/dependency, social change, and land use as a sociopolitical and cultural struggle. Students should consult www.eas.cornell.edu/cals/eas/academics regarding the status of this course.
SOC3570;;;Schooling, Racial Inequality, and Public Policy in America;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;;;;After examining alternative explanations for why individuals obtain different amounts and types of educational training, the course focuses on how an individual's family background and race affect his or her trajectory through the educational system. The course covers the specific challenges that have confronted urban schooling in America since the 1960s, including the classic literature on the effects of school and community resources on student achievement as well as the development and later evaluation of school desegregation policies. The course also considers case studies of current policy debates in the US, such as housing segregation and school resegregation, voucher programs for school choice, the motivation for the consequences of the establishment of state-mandated testing requirements, and the prospects of charter schooling.
SOC3710;;;Comparative Social Inequalities;;;3;;;Spring.;;;(SBA-AS);;;Prerequisite: Introductory social science course.;;;DSOC3700;;;The course begins by identifying the origins of social inequality within the transition to agricultural society. Second, the course describes how inequality is reconfigured by the transition from agriculture to industry. Contemporary social science perspectives on industrial society are then entertained, and it is acknowledged that there is a lack of consensus about the portent of rising inequality that began during the late 20th Century. To frame this question, the course embarks upon a comparative historical analysis of industrialization to determine where society may be heading. Because the trend in inequality suggests that a new social order is in the making, the course ultimately asks, "What might be contours of the new social order?"
SOC3750;;;Classical Theory;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;;;;Introduction to the classics in sociology, primarily works by Karl Marx, Max Weber, Emile Durkheim, and Georg Simmel. Students also study the works of Alexis de Tocqueville, Montesquieu, and Joseph Schumpeter. Special emphasis is put on the concepts, ideas, and modes of explanation that characterize the classics. Students also look at these writers' empirical material, and what may be termed the social construction of the classics. Course requirements include active class participation and three tests in class.
SOC3760;;;Multicultural Israel;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;GOVT3766;JWST3767;NES3767;;;In the media we read about conflict in Iraq between Sunnis, Shiites, and Kurds; strife between Muslims and Copts in Egypt; rebellion in Syria against the ruling Alawite minority; and violence between Israelis and Palestinians; and the list goes on. This course aims to enrich students' understanding of the diversity of Middle Eastern countries, exploring histories of inter-communal contact and conflict. In commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of World War I, we will begin our exploration by reflecting on the legacy of the Ottoman Empire and the impact of its dissolution. We will focus our attention on commercial centers that fostered inter-communal relations, as well as investigating sites of strife and cases of minority repression. We will read histories, memoirs, and fiction, and view films that help us better understand inter-communal relations, tensions, and conflict. We will also interrogate the terms for exploring a range distinctions among majority and minority populations including: religious difference (Muslims, Christians, and Jews); divisions of religious rite (Sunni and Shiite); entho-linguistic minorities (Armenians and Kurds); national identities (Israelis and Palestinians); cultures of origin (Mizrahi, Sephardi, and Ashkenazi Jews).
SOC3850;;;Mass Incarceration and Family Life Course;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;;;;The goal of this course is to provide a more complete analysis of the effects of mass imprisonment on urban family and community life. In it, we will consider urban family life before the prison boom, research on the effects of incarceration on specific outcomes, and broad accounts of how imprisonment affects urban family life.
SOC4160;;;Ethnography of Poverty and Inequality;;;3;;;Spring.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;PAM4160;;;This course explores poverty and inequality in American society through the lens of ethnographic and other field-based research. We will read classic and contemporary texts which have shaped our understanding of how social inequality and exclusion constrain people's daily lives and how groups develop innovative responses to these constraints.
SOC4330;;;Seminar in Economy and Society;;;3;;;Fall.;;;(SBA-AS);;;Prerequisite: for undergraduates two courses in economic sociology and economics, or permission of instructor.;;;SOC6330;;;Economic sociology extends the sociological perspective to the study economic life. The seminar examines the view that social networks, norms, beliefs and rules motivate and enable economic action in market and nonmarket settings. It integrates the study of ideas and theory in economic sociology with a practicum providing training in the craft of research. Designed for advanced undergraduates interesting in research and graduate students who seek training in economic sociology, the seminar offers a year-long workshop environment enabling and guiding independent and collaborative research.
SOC4390;;;Social Dynamics and Computational Methods;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;SOC6390;;;This seminar addresses theoretical and empirical research topics related to the study of complex social networks, or as some have characterized the field, "the new science of networks." These can range from very large online networks to very small artificial networks. Priority is given to topics closely related to current research in the Social Dynamics Laboratory at Cornell.
SOC4430;;;Topics in Social and Political Philosophy;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(KCM-AS);;;;;;AMST4655;AMST6656;GOVT4655;GOVT6656;PHIL4470;PHIL6430;SOC6430;;;Topic: Equality Efforts to reduce inequality are central to the pursuit of justice. We will investigate leading philosophical controversies about the moral basis of these efforts. To what extent, in what ways and why should the economic inequalities that arise in modern market societies be reduced? At what point does the use of government to reduce economic inequality unjustly conflict with liberty? How should the ideal of political equality be understood? For example, is it fundamentally important that citizens' political influence be approximately equal? What do the values underlying demands for political equality imply about relationships in the workplace? Do duties to reduce economic and political inequality among fellow-citizens properly extend worldwide?
SOC4520;;;Sociology of Race & Education;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;ASRC4516;ASRC6516;SOC6510;;;We will undertake an in-depth study of racial inequality and its relationship to schooling. The course content is centered primarily on the schooling challenges facing Black, Latino, Asian, and Native American students. We will investigate how issues such as the resegregation of schools, academic tracking, and teacher quality impact student achievement. The course reviews classic theoretical perspectives in the sociology of education, including education as social reproduction or cultural capital. Special attention will be given to the conceptualization and measurement of racial gaps in standardized test scores since the 1970s. We will also give some attention to how the debates surrounding race and education are influenced by popular discourse, including film documentaries.
SOC4570;;;Health and Social Behavior;;;3;;;Fall.;;;;;;Prerequisite: SOC 1101, DSOC 1101, and a course in statistics.;;;HD4570;;;Be able to contrast multiple theoretical perspectives on a research issue.
SOC4580;;;The Science of Social Behavior;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;Prerequisite: At least one statistics course.;;;COMM4580;HD4580;ILRLR4580;;;This is a small capstone seminar for select seniors (and the occasional junior) who are interested in graduate study in scientific disciplines that focus on human behavior and social interaction. The course mirrors HD 2580 "Six Pretty Good Books," an introductory lecture course for entering students and students whose majors are outside the social and behavioral sciences. Both classes (2580 and 4580) will use the same set of readings, but the seminar format is a weekly 90-minute in-depth discussion rather than lecture. Most importantly, unlike 2580, 4580 is not about the books; rather, it is about how to teach the books.  Much of our in-class analysis of the books centers on identifying what are the key contributions to knowledge, as well as important limitations, and how best to communicate these ideas to students with little background in the social sciences. All students are provided the opportunity to lead one or more discussion groups in 2580.  In addition to facilitating metacognitive understanding of the books, the seminar has two additional goals: 1) to provide advanced undergraduates with an opportunity to summon, integrate, and apply insights that they have acquired over the course of their undergraduate education as they analyze arguments from the standpoint of multiple social sciences, and 2) to integrate scholarship across disciplinary lines, a major goal of University Courses.
SOC4780;;;The Family and Society in Africa;;;4;;;Fall, summer.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;ASRC4606;ASRC6066;;;"The family, as a social institution, is structured according to historical, socio-economic, political, and cultural factors. Course topics include the concepts of the nuclear and extended family, the roles, rights and obligations of different age groups and generations; and marriage and its related issues, including parenthood, childrearing, and gender roles. Other issues examined are reproductive health, family planning, sexuality and fertility (particularly during adolescence), family codes, and legal implications. The course deals also with structural change and continuity, the impact of westernization, urbanization, formal education, and the contemporary economy on the structure and challenges of the family in Africa. Finally, the legacy of African family values and traditions in the African Diaspora, with a focus on the African-American experience, is discussed."
SOC4910;;;Independent Study;;;1-4;;;Fall, spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;This is for undergraduates who wish to obtain research experience or to do extensive reading on a special topic.
SOC4950;;;Honors Research;;;4;;;Fall, spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;
SOC4960;;;Honors Thesis: Senior Year;;;4;;;Fall, spring.;;;;;;Prerequisite: SOC 4950.;;;;;;
SOC5010;;;Basic Problems in Sociology I;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;Analysis of theory shaping current sociological research. Examination of several central problems in sociological inquiry provides an occasion for understanding tensions and continuities between classical and contemporary approaches, for indicating the prospects for unifying microsociological and macrosociological orientations, and for developing a critical appreciation of efforts to integrate theory and research.
SOC5020;;;Basic Problems in Sociology II;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;Continuation of SOC 5010. Emphasis is on the logical analysis of theoretical perspectives, theories, and theoretical research programs shaping current sociological research. The course includes an introduction to basic concepts used in the logical analysis of theories and examines their application to specific theories and theoretical research programs. Theoretical perspectives include functionalism, social exchange, and interactionism.
SOC5710;;;Social and Political Context of American Education;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;AMST2710;AMST5710;DSOC2710;DSOC5710;EDUC2710;EDUC5710;SOC2710;;;Examines the goals, roles, inputs, and outcomes of schooling in American society, and the policy environment in which schools operate. Analyzes controversies and tensions (e.g., equity, market forces, state control) surrounding public education at local, state, and federal levels. Includes current and historical, urban, and rural issues and problems.
SOC6010;;;Statistics for Sociological Research;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;Sociological theory relies on the analysis of data to make claims about how the world works. This course will provide students with a firm understanding of how to analyze data quantitatively to inform theory. Although this is not a mathematics course, students will learn about the concepts and mechanics that underlie statistical procedures and regression models that are prominent in quantitative sociological research. Students will also have a first-hand opportunity to analyze data that speaks to questions that they are interested in.
SOC6020;;;Linear Models;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;PAM6820;;;This course provides an in-depth examination of linear modeling. We begin with the basics of linear regression, including estimation, statistical inference, and model assumptions. We then review several tools for diagnosing violations of statistical assumptions and what to do when things go wrong, including dealing with outliers, missing data, omitted variables, and weights. Finally, we will explore extensions of the linear regression model, including models for categorical outcomes and hierarchical linear modeling. While statistical modeling is the focus of the course, we proceed with the assumption that models are only as good as the theoretical and substantive knowledge behind them. Thus, in covering the technical material, we will spend considerable time discussing the link between substantive knowledge and statistical practice. The course is designed primarily for graduate students in sociology.
SOC6030;;;Graduate Research Practicum;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;This course is designed to assist the student's professional development on a "learning by doing and feedback" basis. The course is organized around presentation and discussion of ongoing research projects. The course is suitable for second and third year students who are writing or expanding their qualifying papers and for advanced graduate students who have dissertation results to share, as well as a venue for independent research pursued by individual or collaborating students. Weekly meetings are typically organized around a student paper draft distributed to the group. As a general rule the course welcomes auditors and all members of the sociology community interested in the variety of research being pursued at Cornell, though participation is with the permission of the instructor(s). In most semesters, two faculty members will jointly lead the course.
SOC6060;;;Sociology Colloquium;;;1;;;Fall, spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;A series of talks representative of current research interests in sociology, given by distinguished visitors and faculty members.

SOC6310;;;Qualitative Research Methods for Studying Science;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;STS6311;;;Much has been learned about the nature of science by sociologists and anthropologists donning lab coats and studying scientists in action. This course looks at the methods used in this new wave of science studies. Examines what can be learned by interviewing scientists, from videos, and from detailed examinations of scientific texts. Students gain hands-on experience by conducting a mini-project in which they investigate some aspect of scientific culture.
SOC6330;;;Seminar in Economy and Society;;;3;;;Fall.;;;;;;Prerequisite: for undergraduates two courses in economic sociology and economics, or permission of instructor.;;;SOC4330;;;Economic sociology extends the sociological perspective to the study economic life.

SOC6380;;;Readings in Economic Sociology;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;The course examines different sectors of the economy of formal sectors, like firms, corporations &amp; consumers markets, to the informal sector, including illegal markets. It looks at non-traditional markets &amp; household economies. The main goal of the course it to demonstrate and explain how the ways in which markets and economies function in real life transsend narrow economic principles and assumptions and are imbued with cultural meaning and equally subject to sociological forces.
SOC6390;;;Social Dynamics and Computational Methods;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;SOC4390;;;This seminar addresses theoretical and empirical research topics related to the study of complex social networks, or as some have characterized the field, "the new science of networks." These can range from very large online networks to very small artificial networks. Priority is given to topics closely related to current research in the Social Dynamics Laboratory at Cornell.
SOC6410;;;Methods for Social Network Analysis;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;It will introduce graduate students to the methodology of social network analysis. We will begin by discussing the different types of network data before exploring how these data are collected, and the strengths and limitations of each resulting data structure. We will then learn about methods of data cleaning and the particular complications that non-response or truncated responses can introduce to network studies. Finally, we will introduce several types of analytic approaches including ego-network data analysis, MRQAP, Stochastic Actor-Oriented Models (Siena), and Exponential Random Graph models (ERGMs). Familiarity with R will be helpful but is not required. Students will be expected to develop their own network project throughout the semester, potentially collecting their own data.
SOC6420;;;Sociology of Diffusion;;;2;;;Fall, spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;Diffusion - the spread of social practices - is of central interest for the way it combines attention to social structure and social change. The course reviews theory and method in both classic and contemporary diffusion studies. Theoretical perspectives include choice-theoretic ideas about the gains to mimicry under uncertainty, network analysis of the relational structures that facilitate diffusion, and institutional accounts of the way actors interpret and normalize social practices. Methodological approaches include analysis of the distribution of adoption times, event history models of individual adoption, spatial correlation, simulation, and process tracing. Discussion of statistical methods is introduced with a focus on concepts, and is designed to be accessible to doctoral students regardless of prior coursework in multivariate data analysis.

For example, is it fundamentally important that citizens' political influence be approximately equal? What do the values underlying demands for political equality imply about relationships in the workplace? Do duties to reduce economic and political inequality among fellow-citizens properly extend worldwide?
SOC6440;;;Urban Structure and Process;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;This seminar will provide a graduate-level examination of the social organization of urban communities. We will begin with the classic urban sociological theories of the Chicago School and recent extensions and revisions of this perspective. Then, we will consider both qualitative and quantitative approaches to the study of topics including urban social networks, neighborhood social context, urban inequality and social problems, and processes of urban change. Class meetings will focus on discussion of readings with the aim of identifying directions for further research and, in the second half of the semester, the development of research papers.
SOC6510;;;Sociology of Race & Education;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;ASRC4516;ASRC6516;SOC4520;;;We will undertake an in-depth study of racial inequality and its relationship to schooling. The course content is centered primarily on the schooling challenges facing Black, Latino, Asian, and Native American students. We will investigate how issues such as the resegregation of schools, academic tracking, and teacher quality impact student achievement. The course reviews classic theoretical perspectives in the sociology of education, including education as social reproduction or cultural capital. Special attention will be given to the conceptualization and measurement of racial gaps in standardized test scores since the 1970s. We will also give some attention to how the debates surrounding race and education are influenced by popular discourse, including film documentaries.
SOC6660;;;Event History Analysis;;;2;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;Event history analysis (also known as hazard or survival analysis) is a family of methods for the study of discrete outcomes over time. Typical sociological examples are demographic events (births, deaths), entry and exit from a social status (like marriage) and structural change (such as social revolutions). This class introduces main concepts, models, and measurement issues in event history analysis, and provides students with an opportunity to gain practical familiarity with these methods. 
SOC6910;;;Independent Study;;;1-4;;;Fall or spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;For graduates who wish to obtain research experience or to do extensive reading on a special topic. Permission to enroll for independent study is granted only to students who present an acceptable prospectus and secure the agreement of a faculty member to serve as supervisor for the project throughout the semester.
SOC7780;;;Solidarity in Groups;;;3;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;ILROB7780;;;It analyzes contemporary theories of group solidarity. Particular attention is given to the comparison of rational choice, social exchange, and normative/affective explanations for the development and maintenance of social solidarity at both the micro (group) level and macro (organizational) level. Trust, emotion, and social identities also are analyzed in the context of these approaches. Most of the theoretical work covered in the course falls within the sociological tradition.

SPAN2230;;;Perspectives on Spain;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;;;;An introduction to Spain's history, plural cultures, and present-day society. Through a series of key literary works, films, and other visual representations we will explore such topics as the place of tradition, religion, and the family in modern Spain. Our focus will be on the transformation of Spain from an authoritarian state under General Franco's dictatorship (1939-1975) into a remarkably diverse and pluralistic nation in which linguistic, cultural, political, and gender differences have been consecrated in a very progressive legislation. This course satisfies the main requirement for the minor in Spanish, may be used as an elective for the major, and is crucial to those planning to study abroad in Spain in the near future.

SPAN4350;;;Postcolonial Poetry and the Poetics of Relation;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;COML4290;COML6350;ENGL4840;ENGL6850;FREN4350;FREN6350;SPAN6350;;;What kinds of poetry might be usefully characterized as "postcolonial" and what are the stakes of such a designation? How common, variable, translatable are values deemed "postcolonial" for particular poetics across cultures? Is there such a thing as a transnational, transcultural, "Postcolonial Poetics?" What relation(s) do specific textual/poetic features or strategies have to geopolitical, cultural, historical, economic circumstances, and to the condition(s) of what has come to be called the "postcolonial" in particular? With special reference to Edouard Glissant's influential concept of a "poetics of relation," attending as well to our own situatedness as readers-perhaps also, though not necessarily, as writers-of poetry within U.S. (and) academic context(s), this seminar will focus on Caribbean poetry as an especially fruitful site for exploring a diversity of approaches to these and related questions concerning postcoloniality, poetry, community, language, culture, and identity.
SPAN4550;;;Cervantes: Don Quixote;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;Prerequisite: two of SPAN 2140, SPAN 2150, SPAN 2170 or permission of instructor.;;;;;;Don Quijote is not only "the first modern work of literature," as Michel Foucault noted, but also "the first European novel," as the novelist Kundera hailed it. In fact, Foucault believed that Cervantes's discovery of the arbitrary relation of words and things ushered in the modern age. Four centuries before Freud, Cervantes questioned the meaning of madness, inquiring into the close bonds between delusions and fantasy, dreams and artistic production. A revolutionary document of its own age, Don Quijote confronts us with the complex history of Christians, Jews, and Muslims in Spain, especially with the conflicts between Christianity and Islam in the Iberian Peninsula. Stressing a critique of creation within Cervantes's own creation, our close reading of Don Quijote will examine Cervantes's subversion of early modern Spanish literary genres. We will also explore the links established by his masterpiece with the network of institutions, practices, and beliefs that constituted 16th and 17th century Spanish culture. Our readings will be supplemented with an ample range of critical approaches.

SPAN4640;;;The Other Iberia;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;;;;This course seeks to explore the cultural and linguistic diversity of Spain by analyzing literary texts from regions that still remain in the periphery of Peninsular studies:  Catalonia, Basque Country, and Galicia.  We will examine how identities are shaped and contested in Spain by discussing the works of authors such as Kirmen Uribe, Maria Barbal, Carme Riera, Bernardo Atzaga, and Suso de Toro.
SPAN4825;;;The Architecture of Desire - Luis Bunuel and Film Theory;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;;;;This course explores the films of renowned auteur Luis Bunuel in conjunction with different theories of film, aesthetics, and politics. Tracing his work from the inception of Surrealism to the final stage of his career in the late 1970s, the course proposes an in-depth study of the Bunuelian canon, placing his work in dialogue with contemporary debates on decadence, subjectivity, politics, desire, and sexuality. In addition to scholarship on Bunuel, we will read works by Kracauer, Deleuze, Tarkovsky, Theweleit, Ranciere, Mulvey, Eisenstein, Foucault, and Zizek.
SPAN4870;;;The Forgotten and the Damned: An Alternative History of Latin American Literature;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;;;;Latin American literature is full of writers who one day were relevant but today have been forgotten. It is also full of writers whose life was so colorful that it has tended sometimes to obscure the merits of the work. This course will focus on these neglected and "damned" writers, trying to chart a sort of alternative history of Latin American literature. We will read authors such as Clemente Palma, Nellie Campobello, Francisco Tario, Hilda Mundy, Josefina Vicens, Jaime Saenz.
SPAN6100;;;Marx and Marxisms;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;COML6631;GERST6100;GOVT6706;;;The terms "Marx" and "Marxisms" have meant different things to different people, beginning with Marx himself and continuing in his legacy today.  As obviously, this legacy remains global (Europe, North and Latin America, India and Pakistan, Vietnam, Africa, Near East and Far East)--all still including imagined allies, neutrals, and foes.  This seminar is an approach to this otherwise bewildering complexity: we focus on two things: (1) a possible Marxist (or Communist or Anarchist) theory of all language and any semiotics; alongside (2) its equally possible inter-action with manuals of guerrilla warfare.
SPAN6320;;;Listening and Audio Cultures;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;AMST7320;COML6999;LSP6320;MUSIC7320;;;This seminar focuses on the political economy of sound and listening in the configuration of urban space in Latin America and among Latino communities in the U.S. The city will be approached from a multidisciplinary perspective centered on the experience of sound and listening as a critical component in the performance of the social, cultural, political, and ethnic subjectivities and objectivities of the urban.

SPAN6720;;;Roberto Bolano and the Problem of Evil;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;This course examines the life and work of the late Chilian writer Roberto Bolano, one of the most influential writers in twenty-first century literature. We will study his poems, essays, short stories and novels, focusing in his constant obsession with the problem of evil, which he explored in multiple contexts: local, Latin American, and global. We will see the philosophical and literary underpinnings of his writing, the way Bolano created his particular universe, in which horror and humor go hand in hand.
SPAN6730;;;Cartographic Fictions;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;This course explores the role of the renewed interest in cartography in both literature and the arts, while attempting to lay out a conceptual framework for the definition of mapmaking in a broad sense, which is not necessarily land-based.  From a random walk through the city to the global market of capitalism, the guiding question is how cultural artifacts make sense out of the real conditions of existence.  The aim is not only to offer different answers but to reformulate the problem as to how experiencing the world involves a variety of interpretive legends to situate our lives through some form of cartographic plotting-one way or another of mapping the territory, whether real or imaginary, public or private, official or marginal, conscious or unconscious.  Authors and artists include Cortazar, Gopequi, Kuitca, Borges, Auster, Calvino, and  others.
SPAN6740;;;Medieval Travel Writing;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;COML6725;JWST6740;MEDVL6740;NES6740;;;We will read a selection of medieval travel accounts, paying special attention to the ways in which travelers observed, interacted with, and described the people they encountered and the places they visited.  Material will include:  Buzurg ibn Shahrayar's Wonders of the Indian Ocean, Ibn Fadlan's Mission to the Volga, Evliya Celebi'sBook of Travels, the anonymous Ottoman History of the New World, and European material including Marco Polo, Sir John Mandeville, and Bartolomeo de las Casas.  All material in English and/or Spanish.
SPAN6820;;;The Architecture of Desire - Luis Bunnuel and Film Theory;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;This course explores the films of renowned auteur Luis Bunuel in conjunction with different theories of film, aesthetics, and politics. Tracing his work from the inception of Surrealism to the final stage of his career in the late 1970s, the course proposes an in-depth study of the Bunuelian canon, placing his work in dialogue with contemporary debates on decadence, subjectivity, politics, desire, and sexuality.

STS1102;;;Histories of the Future;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;HIST1620;;;From Frankenstein to The Matrix, science fiction and film have depicted contemporary science, technology, and medicine for almost two centuries. This course introduces students to historical and social studies of science and technology using science-fiction films and novels, as well as key readings in science and technology studies. What social questions can fictional accounts raise that factual ones can only anticipate? How have "intelligent machines" from Babbage's Analytical Engine to Hal raised questions about what it means to be human? What can Marvel Comics teach us about changes in science and technology? When can robots be women and, in general, what roles did gender play in scientific, technological, and medical stories? How was the discovery that one could look inside the human body received? How do dreams and nightmares of the future emerge from the everyday work of scientific and technological research?

STS1201;;;Information Ethics, Law, and Policy;;;3;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;INFO1200;;;This course investigates the ethical, legal, and social foundations of information. Through lectures, readings, and independent projects, the class will learn to analyze and engage key challenges ranging from privacy in big data and ubiquitous computing environments, to the nature of property, organization, collaboration, and innovation in an increasingly networked world. With cases drawn from the fields of science, health care, education, politics, culture, and international development, and theories and methods from across the humanities and social sciences (law, philosophy, cultural studies, sociology, organizations, and several others) this course will teach students to engage critically and strategically with the worlds of information and technology around them.
STS1941;;;The History of Science in Europe: From the Ancient Legacy to Isaac Newton;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;BSOC1941;HIST1941;;;How did the approaches to knowledge of nature that developed in medieval and early-modern Europe create an enterprise that associated the practical manipulation of nature with scientific truth? This course surveys intellectual approaches to the natural world from the theologically-shaped institutions of the Middle Ages to the Scientific Revolution of the 16th and 17th centuries. Ancient Greek authors such as Aristotle and Archimedes were used in diverse ways that came to usher in an era of European global expansion. By the late 17th century, a new kind of practically applicable science attempted to demonstrate Francis Bacon's famous claim that "knowledge is power."
STS2011;;;What Is Science? An Introduction to the Social Studies of Science and Technology;;;3-4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;SOC2100;;;Introduces some of the central ideas in the field of S&amp;TS. As well as serving as an introduction to students who plan to major in Biology and Society or in Science and Technology Studies, the course is aimed at students with backgrounds in either the sciences or the humanities who are challenged to think more critically about what we mean by science, what counts as scientific knowledge and why, and how science and technology intervene in the wider world. The course is a mixture of lecture, discussion, and other activities. The discussion sections are an integral part of the course and attendance is required. In addition, a series of written assignments throughout the semester and a take-home final during exam week compose the majority of the grade.
STS2051;;;Ethical Issues in Health and Medicine;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(KCM-AS);;;;;;BSOC2051;;;In today's rapidly changing world of health and medicine, complex ethical issues arise in many contexts from the private, interpersonal interactions between doctor and patient to the broad, mass-mediated controversies that make medicine into headline news. This course examines ethical problems and policy issues that rise in contemporary medicine, health care, and biomedical research. Tools for ethical research are applied to a variety of topics and fundamental questions in bioethics. Perspectives from social science, history, and law also inform the course, which will consider ethical issues in their social and institutional context. We will explore problems that arise in a number of substantive areas, including the doctor-patient relationship, end-of-life decision making, distributive justice and health care, human experimentation, reproductive technology, public health, and human genetics. The course will also examine the relatively new field of bioethics itself, raising questions about what issues count as ethical ones and exploring the role of ethical expertise in contemporary societies. This course is also designated as a University Course.  Please visit blogs.cornell.edu/universitycourses/ for further information.
STS2061;;;Ethics and the Environment;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(KCM-AS);;;;;;BSOC2061;PHIL2460;;;Politicians, scientists, and citizens worldwide face many environmental issues today, but they are neither simple nor straightforward. Moreover, there are many ways to understand how we have, do, and could value the environment from animal rights and wise use to deep ecology and ecofeminism. This class acquaints students with some of the challenging moral issues that arise in the context of environmental management and policy-making, both in the past and the present. Environmental concerns also highlight important economic, epistemological, legal, political, and social issues in assessing our moral obligations to nature as well as other humans. This course examines various perspectives expressed in both contemporary and historical debates over environmental ethics by exploring four central questions: What is nature? Who counts in environmental ethics? How do we know nature? Whose nature?
STS2071;;;Introduction to the History of Medicine;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;BSOC2071;HIST2710;;;This course offers an introductory survey of the history of medicine (principally in Europe and the United States) from classical antiquity to the early twentieth century. Using a combination of both primary and secondary sources, students will learn about the "Hippocratic Heritage" of contemporary western medicine; medicine in late antiquity; faith and healing in the medieval period; medicine and knowledge in the Islamic world; medicine during the Renaissance (particularly the rise of the mechanical philosophy); medicine in the age of Enlightenment; professionalization, women-doctors and midwives, and battles over 'quackery' in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries; the role of medicine in colonialism and empire; and the promises and perils of modern medicine (dramatic decreases in mortality on the one hand, the rise of Eugenics and the importance of Medicine to the National Socialist State on the other). As well as this temporal survey, we will consider a number of ongoing themes: race, bodily difference, and medicine; medicine and the environment; women, gender, and medicine; the history of the body; the history of sexuality; and the close connections between forms of social order and forms of medical knowledge. The course meets three times a week (for two lectures and a section) and is open to all.
STS2122;;;Darwin and the Making of Histories;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;BSOC2122;HIST2122;;;The power of a name is sometimes as great as that of an idea. This course will study who Darwin was in his own time, and how he became, then and now, an icon rather than just a Victorian naturalist. We will look at writings of Darwin himself, and attempt to understand what they meant in their own time, how Darwin came to write them, and how his contemporaries helped to shape their future.  How did Victorian ideologies of gender, race, and class shape the production and reception of Darwin's work? We will also examine the growth of "Darwinism" as a set of broader social and cultural movements, particularly in Britain and the United States. Were eugenics movements examples or perversions of Darwinism?  Finally, we will consider how Darwin's name has been used by more recent evolutionary biologists such as Steven Jay Gould, and by American anti-evolutionists.
STS2131;;;Science Fiction;;;4;;;Fall, summer.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;COML2035;ENGL2035;;;Science fiction, as Fredric Jameson put it, is "the only kind of literature that can reach back and colonize reality." Today more than ever, when science and technology have penetrated everyday life in ways that would have seemed impossible only a few decades ago, it has become apparent that science fiction is not merely a literary genre but a whole way of being, thinking, and acting in the modern world. The course explores classic and contemporary science fiction from Frankenstein to The Hunger Games alongside a rich array of fiction, films, and new media from Europe, Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Our discussions will position these works vis-a-vis seminal thinkers, ranging from Plato to Descartes and Donna Haraway to Paul Crutzen, who ask the same questions as science fiction does about ourselves, our world, and our future.
STS2231;;;Energy in History;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;HIST2131;;;In this seminar, we will explore the role of energy as a force in the driving of history.  With the widespread harnessing of fossil fuels in the nineteenth century as our pivot point, we will consider both the prior energy regimes of wood, wind, water, and human and animal muscle, as well as the politics of energy production and consumption from the industrial age to the present.  While attentive to issues of environmental impact, we will also examine the broader implications of energy use for social, economic, and political structures across time.  Readings will consist of both classic works and recent scholarship, with cases drawn from all around the globe.
STS2261;;;Medicine and Healing in China;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;ASIAN2262;BSOC2261;CAPS2262;HIST2262;;;An exploration of processes of change in medicine in China.  Focuses on key transitions, such as the emergence of canonical medicine, of Daoist approaches to healing and longevity, of Buddhist medicine and medical relief, of "Scholar Physicians," and of "traditional Chinese medicine" in modern China.  Examines the development of new healing practices in relation to both popular and specialist views of the body and disease, "cultivating vitality" practices, modes of transmission of medical knowledge, and healer-patient relations.
STS2331;;;Agriculture, History, and Society: From Squanto to Biotechnology;;;3;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;AMST2331;;;Surveys the major themes in the development of agriculture and agribusiness in the United States in the 19th and 20th centuries. These include particular individuals (e.g., Liberty Hyde Bailey, Luther Burbank, G. W. Carver, Henry A. Wallace, and Norman Borlaug), the rise of government support and institutions (including U.S.D.A. and Cornell), noteworthy events (the dust bowl, World War II, and the environmental movement), and the achievements of the Green and "Gene" Revolutions.
STS2468;;;Medicine, Culture, and Society;;;3;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ANTHR2468;BSOC2468;;;Medicine has become the language and practice through which we address a broad range of both individual and societal complaints. Interest in this "medicalization of life" may be one of the reasons that medical anthropology is currently the fastest-growing subfield in anthropology. This course encourages students to examine concepts of disease, suffering, health, and well-being in their immediate experience and beyond. In the process, students will gain a working knowledge of ecological, critical, phenomenological, and applied approaches used by medical anthropologists. We will investigate what is involved in becoming a doctor, the sociality of medicines, controversies over new medical technologies, and the politics of medical knowledge. The universality of biomedicine (or hospital medicine) will not be taken for granted, but rather we will examine the plurality generated by the various political, economic, social, and ethical demands under which biomedicine has developed in different places and at different times. In addition, biomedical healing and expertise will be viewed in relation to other kinds of healing and expertise. Our readings will address medicine in North America as well as other parts of the world. In class, our discussions will return regularly to consider the broad diversity of kinds of medicine throughout the world, as well as the specific historical and local contexts of biomedicine.
STS2501;;;Technology in Society;;;3;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;ECE2500;ENGRG2500;HIST2500;;;Investigates the social, technical, political, and economic history of technology in Europe and the United States from the Industrial Revolution in the late 18th century to the present. Topics include industrialization, modernization, and globalization. We study such themes as the government's promotion and regulation of technology; gender, race, and labor issues; and the relationship between technological and social change.
STS2821;;;Science in Western Civilization: Newton to Darwin, Darwin to Einstein;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;BSOC2821;HIST2820;;;This course aims to make comprehensible both to science majors and to students of the humanities the historical  structure and development of modern science and to show sciences as cultural phenomena. Changing perceptions of nature and human knowledge from Greek Antiquity to the twentieth century form the framework for current Western views of the world, while the roots of the present-day dominance of "science" as a symbol of progress and modernity lie in an alliance between knowledge of nature and power over nature that took shape in the nineteenth century after a long period of emergence. This course covers the eighteenth, nineteenth, and early twentieth centuries.  
STS2851;;;Communication, Environment, Science, and Health;;;3;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;COMM2850;;;Environmental problems, public health issues, scientific research-in each of these areas, communication plays a fundamental role. From the media to individual conversations, from technical journals to textbooks, from lab notes to the web, communication helps define scientifically based social issues and research findings. This course examines the institutional and intellectual contexts, processes, and practical constraints on communication in the sciences.
STS2871;;;Evolution;;;3;;;Fall, summer.;;;(PBS);;;;;;BIOEE2070;;;Evolution is the central concept in biology. This course examines evolution as a science and places it in an historical context.  Lectures focus on descent with modification, the nature of natural  selection, the history of the earth, the information content of the fossil record, and processes responsible for diversification (speciation and extinction).  The science of evolutionary biology is presented in the context of a broader history of ideas in science.  The course also explores the importance of evolutionary thinking in the 21st century, including discussion of antibiotic and pesticide resistance, personalized genomics, climate change, and the conflict between creationists and evolutionists. 
STS3011;;;Life Sciences and Society;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;BSOC3011;;;Biology and biotechnology are major sources of influence on personal and social life. In addition, social and historical conditions have profound influence on biological research,and on the applications of such research in medicine, agriculture, and other fields. Biological research itself is a social process involving personal and commercial competition, different styles of work and interpretation, and complex human interactions. The course aims to introduce students to basic science and technology studies (S&amp;TS) perspectives on biological knowledge and biotechnology. Students will be encouraged to critically evaluate and discuss these perspectives. The course is designed to prepare students for more advanced courses in the Biology &amp; Society and S&amp;TS majors, but students who do not plan to take further courses in those subjects can get critical insight into biology's profound role in shaping our modern way of life.
STS3020;;;Science Writing for the Media;;;3;;;Fall.;;;;;;Prerequisite: college-level writing course.;;;COMM3020;;;How to write about science, technology, and medicine for the media. Writing assignments focus on writing news for web sites, blogs, magazines, and other media.
STS3031;;;Making Things Nuclear;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;;;;Today, nuclear things connote power and perils to nations and people around the world. We will examine the changing reasons that nuclear technologies--the artifacts, experts, and codified knowledge associated with radioactive substances--have been coveted and controlled, with special attention to medical, military, and environmental applications. By examining the changing nature of "nuclear" things from the 19th Century to today, we will gain a deeper understanding of how several interlinked and transnational processes--including industrialization, testing, popularization, and the making of codified and formal knowledge--produce technology's material and political power. This seminar course is open to advanced undergraduates from diverse backgrounds; we welcome participants from science, engineering, social science, and the humanities as well as historians of science, technology, and medicine.
STS3111;;;Sociology of Medicine;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;BSOC3111;DSOC3111;SOC3130;;;This course provides an introduction to the ways in which medical practice, the medical profession, and medical technology are embedded in society and culture. We will ask how medicine is connected to various sociocultural factors such as gender, social class, race, and administrative cultures. We will examine the rise of medical sociology as a discipline, the professionalization of medicine, and processes of medicalization and demedicalization. We will look at alternative medical practices and how they differ from and converge with the dominant medical paradigm. We will focus on the rise of medical technology in clinical practice with a special emphases on reproductive technologies. We will focus on the body as a site for medical knowledge, including the medicalization of sex differences, the effect of culture on nutrition, and eating disorders such as obesity and anorexia nervosa. We will also read various classic and contemporary texts that speak to the illness experience and the culture of surgeons, hospitals, and patients, and we will discuss various case studies in the social construction of physical and mental illness.
STS3241;;;Environment, Society, and Land;;;3;;;Spring.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;DSOC3240;SOC3240;;;The purpose of this course is to provide a critical understanding of the interconnectedness of environment and society. A primary focus of the course will be the relationship between environmental and social problems as well as the many political ideologies, philosophies, and movements that have continually redefined how we think of environment and sustainability. By discussing issues of science and technology, popular culture, economics, urbanization, environmental change, racial and gender relations, and social movements, this course will reach a broad understanding of environmental issues. Throughout our exploration of environmental issues we will examine how environmental outcomes, at the local, as well as the global level are affected by (and affect) social inequality, power, community, and knowledge.
STS3311;;;Environmental Governance;;;3;;;Fall.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;BSOC3311;DSOC3311;DSOC6320;NTRES3311;NTRES6310;;;Environmental governance is defined as the assemblage of institutions that regulate society-nature interactions and shape environmental outcomes across a range of spatial and temporal scales.  Institutions, broadly defined, are mechanisms of social coordination including laws (formal) and social norms (informal) that guide the behavior of individuals.  Participants in the course will explore the roles of governments, markets, and collective action in environmental management and mismanagement. We will emphasize interactions among leading environmental policy strategies: public regulation, market-based incentives, and community-based resource management. The course is focused around a set of analytic perspectives.  These theoretical frameworks allow us to synthesize empirical observations and material changes in ways that inform our understanding of contemporary evolution of environmental policy and management.
STS3561;;;Computing Cultures;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ANTHR3061;COMM3560;INFO3561;VISST3560;;;Computers are powerful tools for working, playing, thinking, and living. Laptops, PDAs, webcams, cell phones, and iPods are not just devices, they also provide narratives, metaphors, and ways of seeing the world. This course critically examines how computing technology and society shape each other and how this plays out in our everyday lives. Identifies how computers, networks, and information technologies reproduce, reinforce, and rework existing cultural trends, norms, and values. Looks at the values embodied in the cultures of computing and considers alternative ways to imagine, build, and work with information technologies.
STS3601;;;Ethical Issues in Engineering Practice;;;3;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;ECE3600;ENGRG3600;;;Studies major ethical and social issues involved in engineering practice. The issues include responsibility for designing products that do not harm public health, safety, and welfare; rights of engineers in large corporations; risk analysis and the principle of informed consent; conflict of interest; whistle blowing; trade secrets; and broader concerns such as environmental degradation, cost of health care, computer ethics, and working in multinational corporations. Codes of ethics of the professional engineering societies, ethical theory, and the history and sociology of engineering are introduced to analyze these issues.
STS3811;;;Philosophy of Science;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(KCM-AS);;;;;;PHIL3810;;;This course will cover various topics in the philosophy of science.
STS3991;;;Undergraduate Independent Study;;;1-6;;;Fall, spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;More information and applications available in 306 Rockefeller Hall.
STS4221;;;New York Women;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;FGSS4220;;;Over the centuries New York State has been the site of activity for a great many women of consequence. This course is a one-semester survey of the past and present activities and contributions of rural and urban women in a variety of fields of interest to Cornell students: politics, medicine, science, the law, education, business (including hotels), entertainment, communications, government, labor, religion, athletics, the arts, and other areas. Weekly readings and discussion and a paper, possibly using local or university archives.
STS4240;;;Designing Technology for Social Impact;;;3;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;Technical background is not needed for this course.;;;INFO4240;;;The social impact of technologies is typically thought about fairly late, if ever, in the design process. Indeed, it can be difficult at design time to predict what effects technologies will have. Nevertheless, design decisions can inadvertently "lock in" particular values early on. In this course, we will draw on science &amp; technology studies, technology design, and the arts to analyze the values embodied in technology design and to design technologies to promote positive social impact. What social and cultural values do technology designs consciously or unconsciously promote? To what degree can social impact be "built into" a technology? How can we take social and cultural values into account in design?
STS4291;;;Politics of Science;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;BSOC4291;GOVT4291;;;This course examines scientific controversies that become political. Why does some science become politicized rather than normalized and routinized? How do societies deal with collective uncertainty and risk entailed in authoritative scientific findings? How do social movements respond to niches in contentious knowledge to expand influence? To what extent is science made politically vulnerable by its commitment to incremental evidence-based knowledge in contention with junk science? What do interest-based explanations of politics tell us and leave out? An archetypal case is climate change, but it is one of many. Topics range broadly and will be adjusted to student interests.
STS4301;;;Social Studies of Space, Technologies and Borders;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;DSOC4301;GOVT4807;;;In this course we will discuss how society, culture and politics shape technological artifacts and the natural and built environment, such as bridges, roads, and landscapes in diverse cultural contexts. We will examine reasons for the rise in bordering mechanisms - ranging from walls, barriers to fences within cities as well as along national borders, in such countries such as Ireland, Korea, Germany, the US, and Israel. We will compare how such 'strategies of exclusion' impact local communities, transnational relations and social connectivity across such divides. We will also examine how the growth of gated communities has reconfigured urban spaces and given rise to new forms of spatial and social segregation.
STS4303;;;The GMO Debate: Science and Society;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(SBA-AS);;;;;;BIOPL4303;BSOC4303;CSS4303;GOVT4303;IARD4303;PLBR4303;;;Biotechnology is a broad term for the tools used to alter living organisms for human purposes. Genetic engineering (recombinant DNA technology) is one class of methods used in biotechnology. Private sector firms are actively marketing transgenic crops and other products of biotechnology globally. The public sector has been somewhat less active, but is becoming increasingly involved in transgenic technologies, particularly in less-industrialized countries. Developmental questions begin with those we ask of all technology: at whose cost, to whose benefit? Social movements have arisen to block both the testing and commercializing of biotechnology products, arguing that the developmental consequences are negative. Their objections center on the issues of food sovereignty, effects of land use change on the environment, ownership of transgenic traits and the genetic background in which they are placed (intellectual property), environmental uncertainties/risks, control of the food supply by multinational corporations and human health issues. Students will evaluate the legitimacy of various arguments and political positions relative to scientific findings and cultural norms. They will seek to understand the dimensions of political contention: what is at stake? Why does the controversy reach global dimensions? What are the concrete interests involved?
STS4441;;;Historical Issues of Gender and Science;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;FGSS4440;;;A one-semester survey of women's role in science and engineering from antiquity to the present, with special emphasis on the United States in the 20th century. Readings include biographies and autobiographies of prominent women scientists, educational writings and other primary sources, and recent historical and sociological studies. By the end of the semester, students attain a broad view of the problems that have faced women entering science and those that still remain.
STS4661;;;Public Communication of Science and Technology;;;3;;;Spring.;;;;;;Prerequisite: COMM 2850, or COMM 3020, ENGRC 3500, or permission of instructor.;;;COMM4660;;;Explores the structure, meanings, and implications of "public communication of science and technology" (PCST). Examines the contexts in which PCST occurs, looks at motivations and constraints of those involved in producing information about science for nonprofessional audiences, and analyzes the functions of PCST. Ties existing ideas about PCST to general communication research, and leads to developing new knowledge about PCST. Format is primarily seminar/discussion.
STS4691;;;Food, Agriculture, and Society;;;3;;;Fall.;;;(PBS);;;Prerequisite: introductory ecology course or permission of instructor.;;;BIOEE4690;BSOC4691;;;Multidisciplinary course dealing with the social and environmental impact of food production in the United States and developing countries. Agroecosystems of various kinds are analyzed from biological, economic, and social perspectives. The impacts of traditional, conventional, and alternative agricultural technologies are critically examined in the context of developed and developing economies. Specific topics include biodiversity and ecosystem services in agriculture, transgenic crops, biofuels, urban agriculture, and sustainable development.
STS4751;;;Science, Race, and Colonialism;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;HIST4751;;;This course is divided into three major thematic sections. The first looks at the history of racial thinking in the West. We begin with the existence (or not) of conceptions of biological race in the early- modern period, focusing on early voyages of discovery and so-called "first encounters" between the peoples of the Old and New Worlds.  In the second part of the course we will look at early enunciations of racial thought in the late 18th century and at the problems of classification that these raised, before examining the roots of "Scientific Racism." We close with a look at Darwin, Social Darwinism, and eugenics movements in different national contexts.  The last third of the course looks at science and technology in colonial contexts, including "colonial technologies" (guns, steam- ships, and telegraphs) as well as medicine and public hygiene.
STS4951;;;Social Studies of the Human Sciences;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;;;;Explores how the human and social sciences have provided the knowledge and categories we use to make sense of human beings and their behavior. Looking across a range of disciplines-including sociology, anthropology, psychiatry, psychology, psychoanalysis, and economics-we will look at how human beings have become objects of scientific investigation. We will focus on how culture, politics, and the professional environment impact the human sciences and how the use of rhetoric constitutes academic discourse. We will also focus on the social scientific construction of selves, sex, and gender.
STS4981;;;Romanticism and the Fate of the Senses;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;COML4019;ENGL4491;SHUM4991;;;What if, William Blake once asked, every bird that flies "is an immense world of delight, closed by your senses five?" Asking what real and possible worlds our habits of sensory perception exclude, Romantic poets criticized their culture's increasing faith in sense-based, empirical knowledge - knowledge supposedly free from subjective bias, historical circumstance, national prejudice, and political complicity. This seminar will focus on poetry as a form of sensory re-training and on Romantic and post-Romantic claims to a politics of perception. Can artworks access rival science, non-human experience, or otherwise unthinkable histories - or sensually suspend the pressure to do so? Readings from Blake, Keats, Dickinson, Goethe, Locke, Foucault, Latour, Daston, Ranciere, Bourdieu, Williams, de Man, Adorno, Terada, Stewart, and Hartman.
STS4991;;;Honors Project I;;;4;;;Fall, spring. (Yearlong);;;;;;;;;BSOC4991;HE4991;;;Students must register for 4 credits each semester (4991-4992) for a total of 8 credits. After the first semester, students receive a letter grade of "R"; a letter grade for both semesters is submitted at the end of the second semester whether or not the student completes a thesis or is recommended for honors. Minimally, an honors thesis outline and bibliography should be completed during the first semester. In consultation with the advisors, the director of undergraduate studies will evaluate whether the student should continue working on an honors project. Students should note that these courses are to be taken in addition to those courses that meet the regular major requirements. If students do not complete the second semester of the honors project, they must change the first semester to independent study to clear the "R" and receive a grade. Otherwise, the "R" will remain on their record and prevent them from graduating.
STS4992;;;Honors Project II;;;4;;;Fall, spring. (Yearlong);;;;;;;;;BSOC4992;HE4992;;;Students must register for the 4 credits each semester (4991-4992) for a total of 8 credits. After the first semester, students receive a letter grade of "R"; a letter grade for both semesters is submitted at the end of the second semester whether or not the student completes a thesis or is recommended for honors. Minimally, an honors thesis outline and bibliography should be completed during the first semester. In consultation with the advisors, the director of undergraduate studies will evaluate whether the student should continue working on an honors project.

STS6031;;;Cyber Conflict, Technopolitics and Trust;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;Hacktivism, cyber-crime, cyber-espionage, and cyber-war have become worrisome for individuals, corporations, and nation-states. This course analyses cyber conflict as technopolitics, showing how the specific affordances of information technology shape political possibilities, and how politics in turn shape the evolution of information technology. It is a reading, discussion, and writing-intensive course is designed for graduate students in any field of study who wish to gain a better understanding of the interactions between social, political and technical dimensions of cyberspace. Subjects include the origins of hacker culture and computer security expertise; the rise of public concerns over computer security and privacy; critical infrastructure's growing dependence on information technology; market failures in computer security; and government policies aimed at correcting those failures.
STS6301;;;Social Theory;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;Sociologist C. Wright Mills challenged his readers to develop their "sociological imagination" to understand the social and historical forces at work in seemingly individual events, such as the receipt of a pink slip, a draft card, or a drug prescription. Within science and technology studies, scholars have documented how social issues can become scientific, technological, or medical, often appearing to leave the social realm naturalized, normalized, or pathologized. This course introduces graduate students to classic texts and concepts in social theory with a focus on how scholars apply such theories to empirical research. It will consider major thinkers and schools of social thought, such as Marx, Weber, Durkheim, Mannheim, Foucault, and the Frankfurt School. It will also consider how a nuanced interplay of theory and empirical data can bring critically important insights to both theoretical and empirical understandings of the world. The course is relevant for students in sociology, history, and anthropology who are interested in social theory.
STS6311;;;Qualitative Research Methods for Studying Science;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;SOC6310;;;Much has been learned about the nature of science by sociologists and anthropologists donning lab coats and studying scientists in action. This course looks at the methods used in this new wave of science studies. Examines what can be learned by interviewing scientists, from videos, and from detailed examinations of scientific texts. Students gain hands-on experience by conducting a mini-project in which they investigate some aspect of scientific culture.
STS6331;;;Anthropology of Biomedicine;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;;;;In recent decades, anthropologists have begun to treat biomedicine as ethnomedicine, opening up the cultural assumptions, differences, and contingencies underpinning biomedical science and practice. This course examines biomedicine as a global cultural system, treating human health as a shifting product of nature and culture. Among topics covered will be approaches to illness and suffering, biomedical epistemologies, theories of embodiment, medicalization, and new medical technologies.
STS6561;;;Technologies of Valuation;;;4;;;Spring. (Offered once every 1-2 years);;;;;;;;;INFO6561;;;Valuation is a pervasive feature of contemporary life. Professors, universities, hotels, markets, movies, user experience, intelligence - almost everything is subject to some form of review, rating, or ranking these days. This course examines valuation as a key techno-scientific practice and asks how value is established, maintained, compared, subverted, resisted, and institutionalized in a range of different settings. Through a mix of reading, writing, and practical exercises, we shall engage with theoretical, historical, and ethnographic studies of (e)valuation in science &amp; technology studies, but also draw on related areas like economic sociology, the sociology of evaluation, accounting studies, anthropology, and information science.
STS6671;;;Tools for Analyzing Energy and Society Module;;;1;;;Spring.;;;;;;Prerequisite: CHEME 6660.;;;CHEME6673;ECE5510;;;Module of CHEME 6660 that examines the relationships of technology and society, and the nature and communication of technical knowledge.

STSCI3030;;;Policy Analysis by the Numbers;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;ILRST3030;;;An array of decisions are made by policymakers (regulators, administrators, and politicians) who rely in part on information from data and statistics. What if polices were decided entirely on the empirical evidence or by the numbers? What if we looked at the studies, statistics, and results and made decisions based only on this type of evidence? This course will develop ideas of evidence-based policy making through all stages, from initial problem identification to ending a specific policy, and then apply it to current problems.Topics considered will include pharmaceutical approvals, hyrdrofracking, education initiatives, and health care decisions. Lectures and discussions will include presentations from Cornell researchers. Students will be expected to develop a evidence-based policy issue, find supporting data, and present arguments in support of the issue. Short writing assignments and a final paper will be required.

Classical topics include (but are not limited to): regression, hypothesis testing, maximum likelihood, and resampling.  Modern topics include the Lasso, Bayesian computation, and analysis of observational studies. The perspective will be social, historical and cultural as well as mathematical.  The statistical procedures used today, which underlie policy decisions of global importance in economics, public health, and so forth, did not come from nowhere, but were the result of culturally and historically specific processes. For example, the early history of regression analysis is bound up with the history of "eugenics"; and the early history of hypothesis testing is marked by vigorous (and well-recorded) debates between the proponents of different approaches. We will illuminate these intellectual developments using both original and modern textual sources, and relate them to current scientific enterprises and controversies.

We will consider its urban development from ancient polis to modern metropolis, its marvels of religious architecture from the Hagia Sophia to the Suleymaniye, the splendor of its residences from the Great Palace of the Byzantine Emperors to the Topkapi Sarayi, and the daily life of its humbler residents from the games of the Hippodrome to the taverns and brothels.
VISST3342;;;Human Perception: Application to Computer Graphics, Art, and Visual Display;;;3-4;;;Fall.;;;(KCM-AS);;;Highly recommended prerequisite: PSYCH 2050.;;;COGST3420;PSYCH3420;PSYCH6420;;;Our present technology allows us to transmit and display information through a variety of media. To make the most of these media channels, it is important to consider the limitations and abilities of the human observer. The course considers a number of applied aspects of human perception with an emphasis on the display of visual information. Topics include "three-dimensional" display systems, color theory, spatial and temporal limitations of the visual systems, attempts at subliminal communication, and "visual" effects in film and television.
VISST3505;;;Blaxploitation Film and Photography;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;AMST3515;ARTH3505;ASRC3505;FGSS3505;PMA3505;;;Blaxploitation films of the 1970s are remembered for their gigantic Afros, enormous guns, slammin' soundtracks, sex, drugs, nudity, and violence. Never before or since have so many African American performers been featured in starring roles. Macho male images were projected alongside strong, yet sexually submissive female ones. But how did these images affect the roles that black men and women played on and off the screen and the portrayal of the black body in contemporary society? This interdisciplinary course explores the range of ideas and methods used by critical thinkers in addressing the body in art, film, photography and the media. We will consider how the display of the black body affects how we see and interpret the world by examining the construction of beauty, fashion, hairstyles and gendered images as well as sexuality, violence, race, and hip-hop culture.
VISST3519;;;Music, Dance, and Light;;;3;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;PMA3690;;;Artistic values, parameters, and concerns of music (sound design), dance, and lighting design are compared and contrasted, and the combination of design elements is analyzed in contemporary dance. Includes writing in response to readings, audio and video recordings, and performances. Some classes devoted to creating movement, and lighting.
VISST3560;;;Computing Cultures;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;No technical knowledge of computer use presumed or required.;;;ANTHR3061;COMM3560;INFO3561;STS3561;;;Computers are powerful tools for working, playing, thinking, and living. Laptops, PDAs, webcams, cell phones, and iPods are not just devices, they also provide narratives, metaphors, and ways of seeing the world. This course critically examines how computing technology and society shape each other and how this plays out in our everyday lives. Identifies how computers, networks, and information technologies reproduce, reinforce, and rework existing cultural trends, norms, and values. Looks at the values embodied in the cultures of computing and considers alternative ways to imagine, build, and work with information technologies.
VISST3581;;;Imaginative Arts of Migration;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;AMST3581;COML3580;GERST3581;PMA3481;;;What role should imaginative arts play in debates about transnational migration, one of the principal factors re-shaping community and communication today?  Focusing on literature and film from the late 20th and early 21st centuries, with primary examples drawn from Germany, France and the United States-in relation to Turkey, Hungary, Tunisia, Iran, Nigeria, China, Mexico, and Japan-this course explores how creative arts rework the fabric of social life affected by migration.  Seminar-style discussion of assigned readings and viewings, with occasional lectures on other arts and regions.  Thematic units organized around key concepts such as borders and movement, ethnoscapes and citizenship, reading and viewing, labor and leisure, cityscapes and place-making, mediascapes and personhood, lawfulness and illegality, language and speech, art and perception.
VISST3620;;;Lighting Design Studio I;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;PMA3620;;;The theory and practice of lighting design as a medium for artistic expression. This course explores the aesthetic and mechanical aspects of light and their application in a variety of disciplines.

VISST3650;;;History and Theory of Digital Art;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ARTH3650;INFO3660;;;In this course students will examine the role of mechanical, electronic and digital technologies in the arts of the late 20th and early 21st centuries with emphasis on Europe and North America. Beginning with kinetic art and the cybernetically inspired work of the late sixties, we will explore early uses of computer technology, including early experiments in synthetic video in the 70s. An overview of pre-internet telematic experiments will lead to an investigation of net art. The ongoing development of behavioral art forms including interactive art and interactive installation will be a central theme. Critical evaluation of various attitudes concerning technology will be encouraged.
VISST3670;;;Visualizing el Barrio: Interpreting and Documenting East Harlem's Mural Tradition;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;AMST3672;ARTH3670;ENGL3672;LSP3672;;;Visualizing El Barrio immerses students in a semester-long contemplation and class project that integrates artistic praxis with art history and literary studies to document the historical murals of East Harlem, otherwise known as Spanish Harlem or "El Barrio."  These murals tell stories about people, places, and events that resonate with El Barrio's predominantly Latino/a community and American culture more broadly.  The murals in East Harlem emerge out of a rich Latin American artistic tradition that migrated with the people who comprise the U.S. Latino/a diaspora. Through student research and documentation, "Visualizing El Barrio" will also participate in the preservation of East Harlem's historical murals, culminating in a celebration of the artwork with a student-curated exhibit of photographs and presentations.
VISST3740;;;Painting Nineteenth Century America;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;Recommended prerequisite: ARTH 2400, VISST 2000, or ARTH 4100.;;;AMST3740;ARTH3740;;;Art and everyday life in nineteenth and early-twentieth century America with emphasis on Anglo-European traditions. Considers democratic cultures and identities through topical units: the Peale family and America's first public museum; P.T. Barnum's "freak shows," traveling circus, and working-class audiences; daguerreotypes and the rising middle class; genre painting and regional types including the Yankee peddler, Missouri boatman, and the frontiersman; Hudson River School and the "tourist sublime;" artist-explorers, Darwin, and Latin American as spectacle; class and gender construction in the Gilded Age; the neurasthenic body and the turn of the century; Ashcan School, New York City, and urban spectators; immigrants, "slumming," and documentary photography. Alongside paintings, we examine political cartoons, fashion, advertisements, and popular illustrations.
VISST3798;;;Fundamentals of Directing I;;;3;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;PMA3880;;;Focused, practical exercises teach the student fundamental staging techniques that bring written text to theatrical life. A core objective is to increase the student's awareness of why and how certain stage events communicate effectively to an audience. Each student directs a number of exercises as well as a short scene.
VISST4154;;;Feminism, Post-Feminism, and Cyberfeminism;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ARTH4154;ARTH6154;FGSS4740;FGSS6740;;;In this seminar students will investigate the emergence of feminism in art and theory and subsequent reactions of relevant artists and theorists to that movement. These developments will be discussed in relation to the accelerated technological developments of the twentieth century, which affected not only modes of communication and artistic production but also scientific and popular understandings of bodies, and nature. Themes will include sex and gender, nature, representation, pleasure, technology and the body, race, surveillance, pornography and agency. Media covered in the course include painting, performance, installation, video, film, and interactive digital media.

VISST4161;;;Visual Cultures of the Andes;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ARTH4161;ARTH6161;LATA4161;LATA6161;;;This seminar focuses on visual and performative cultures of the Andes from the Inca empire (ca. 1438-1534) to the present day. It traces the modalities of culture, power, and representation in the framing of Andean pasts and presents by tracing the social lives of images in Andean South America, which encompasses parts of Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, and Argentina. We will analyze a range of visual material, including textiles, paintings, photographs, and even tourist brochures to understand the dynamics of image-making and image consumption in the Andes. Given the seminar's broad temporal scope, we will embark on a series of case studies that serve to contextualize each historical moment of artistic production, from the Inca and colonial periods to the postcolonial period spanning the 19th century to the present. The final section of the course focuses on the politics of marketing "Andeanness" to contemporary audiences through museum displays, folkloric performances, and tourism. Readings will be drawn from an array of disciplines, including art history/visual culture studies, and anthropology.
VISST4176;;;Still Life: Animals, Technology, Representation;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;COML4176;ROMS4176;;;The language of "capture" left hunting and military idioms at the end of the 19th century to pervade today's aesthetic, scientific, technological and critical lexicons. This course examines how this leap from the literal to the metaphorical signaled a sea change in the representation of animal life. Looking at an array of literary, artistic and philosophical texts, the course surveys key contributions to thinking through how mechanized technologies of capture (microscopes, photography, cinema, microphones, etc.) informed and transformed our modern conceptions of subjectivity and objectivity, art and non-art, reality and virtuality, life and death, the animal and the human. Authors may include Flaubert, Poe, Welty, Muybridge, Marey, von Uexkull, Benjamin, Deleuze and Guattari, Herzog, Crary, Chow, Ranciere, Haraway.
VISST4200;;;Proseminar;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;ARTH4100;;;Works of art have always engendered political, social, and cultural meanings. This seminar presents an introduction to the methods used by art historians and the objects and ideas that constitute the historiography of their discipline. If art history was once understood as the study of the development of style in "European art," over the past century its practitioners have attempted to embrace a "global" perspective and to address issues of class, ethnicity, nationality, sexual orientation, and gender. Readings will focus on historically situating methods and the implications of their cross-cultural application. Papers will encourage students to put methods into practice, realizing in the process that subject matter is not an isolated choice to which methods are applied, but something that profoundly affects the approach that the researcher brings to the writing of art history.
VISST4210;;;Dance Technique IV/Classical;;;1;;;Fall, spring.;;;;;;;;;PE1184;PE1186;PMA3210;PMA4210;;;Advanced and pre-professional Western classical dance. A continuation of and supplement to PMA 3210.

Likewise, the mockery or destruction of these monuments is seen as a potent act of political resistance. These phenomena, together with the related concept of "propaganda," have exerted a strong influence on the interpretation of pre-modern ruler portraits. This course will encourage students to think critically about visual cultures of political rule and to develop an account of the distinctions between ancient, medieval, and modern modalities of ruler portraiture and its reception. Our primary case studies will be the late Roman and Soviet states, with ample comparative material drawn from other polities.
VISST4445;;;Nature, Cultural Landscape, and Gardens in Early Modern Italy and France;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ARTH4445;ARTH6445;VISST6445;;;This seminar will examine cultural understandings of nature in early modern Europe, especially Italy, including the notions of "second nature," "cultural landscape," and "pastoral." While agricultural activity transformed the natural landscape in the fifteenth century, so too did ever more extensive gardens. We will study the lavish gardens of cardinals, popes, and dukes that emerged in sixteenth-century Italy, with their terracing, fountains and statues that conceptualized the natural world and depended on developments in mechanics and hydraulics. Many new plant species began entering Europe from the Middle East and the New World in the sixteenth century, followed by the beginnings of botanical gardens in Europe. We will discuss these and the cultural significance of plants, animals, and collections of natural objects. We will also see the role of gardens and alteration to the land in the formation of national identity. The focus of the seminar is on Italian gardens of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries as well as some French gardens, culminating in the Versailles of King Louis XIV.
VISST4454;;;Gangnam Style: Seoul and its Layered Histories;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ASIAN4454;;;This course will take an interdisciplinary, dynamic and experimental approach to study the Seoul city within the larger context of spatial discourses in history, urban culture, literature and visual media.   It will provide students with a tour of this emerging cityscape as it developed from a royal/imperial capital (1392-1910) to a colonial one (1910-45), before becoming the economic hub of a divided peninsula (1945-present).  Seoul, the capital of South Korea, has in the past several years emerged as a truly global cosmopolitan city, boldly aspiring to be the "Center of the World" ("Chongno segye ui chungsim i toeja") and a 21st century "Design City." With a population of 12 million, congested streets, and soaring skyscrapers, Seoul has become an important socioeconomic, political, and cultural center, both within Northeast Asia and throughout the globe. However, underneath the glitter of modernity and globalization visible in the urban sprawl of contemporary Seoul are forgotten stories, stratified claims, and a tumultuous history which Japanese rule, a civil war, and US military presence.  We will examine Seoul's symbolic place in the world community as seen through the 1988 Olympics and how its minorities make this city their home. Special attention will be given to the entrance of technologies, the transformation of architectural spaces, and the emergence of new subjectivities.  By the end of the course, students will not only become familiar with Seoul's past, but also learn important concepts informing the burgeoning field of Korean studies.
VISST4507;;;Topics in Contemporary Art;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;;;;ARTH4507;ARTH6507;;;Topic for spring 2015: The Art Super Star and the Global Art Economy

Students "present" their conclusions about the performance of studied texts through project work as either an actor, director, designer, or dramaturg, as well as through two to three papers.
VISST4563;;;Lighting Design Studio II;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(LA-AS);;;Prerequisite: PMA 2600 or PMA 3620, or permission of instructor.;;;PMA4620;;;Concentrates on designing lighting for different genres of performance in various venues. Emphasis is placed on developing both the visual sophistication and the technical artistry of the lighting designer. Commitment, personal style, and professional presentation are stressed.
VISST4580;;;Seminar in Dance Studies;;;4;;;;;;;;;;;;AAS4080;AMST4080;LSP4080;PMA4080;;;This seminar format course surveys the particular topic -- choreography -- with special attention to theories and practices of race and anti-racism. It introduces dance-based critical thinking, critical viewing, and research writing through written texts, recorded music and embodied performances mostly located in North America. Canonical and emergent dance research texts serve as principle lenses through which seminar discussions, presentations, and workshops, and writing will emerge. This specialized course takes students through a broad yet interconnected range of themes including racial formation and choreography theory, whiteness, Black dancing bodies, Latinidad, choreographing Asian America, and indigenous dance. Throughout the course students engage in interdisciplinary discussions on the racialized body, close readings of dance texts, and analyses of performances. Students will then be challenged to demonstrate their own original analyses through in-class activities, discussion, and a research paper.
VISST4605;;;Art/Science Intersections: More than Meets the Eye;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ARTH4605;ARTH6605;;;This interdisciplinary seminar capitalizes on the extraordinary loan of seventeenth-century Dutch paintings from a private collection to the Johnson Museum, and an ongoing Mellon Foundation initiative to study them and other objects from the Museum's collection, using both art-historical and scientific, data-driven modes of investigation. Both methods are invested in material culture: the communicative visible surface of the artwork and its underlying materials-support, ground, pigment. Within the context of early modern painting and works on paper, and drawing on Cornell's exceptional resources and key experts, we will employ various technical methods, including thread counting of historic canvases, pattern matching in historic papers, and microscopic pigment analysis, and will look for hidden images in paintings through x-ray fluorescence mapping at Cornell's synchrotron facility (CHESS).
VISST4761;;;Art and Social Histories;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;AMST4306;ARTH4761;;;Topic for spring 2015: Mass Culture in the Great Depression This seminar explores public art and popular entertainments as the means for everyday people to politically engage or escape the Great Depression (1929-41).  Discussions include Living Newspapers, the Federal Theater Project, WPA printmakers, FSA photographers (Walker Evans, Dorothea Lange, Gordon Parks, Arthur Rothstein), and Social Realist painters (Reginald Marsh, Ben Shahn). Connecting these is FDR's New Deal, its controversial government support for the arts, and censorship.  We consider dance as political theater, big bands and swing, "screwball" comedies, Busby Berkeley "gold diggers" musicals, and Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers spectaculars.  We begin with the importance of early radio in the home and how it constructed gender and race through soap operas and serial thrillers, especially the Green Hornet and the Shadow.  Students will draw on the digitized American Memory Project, Ken Burns' documentary The Dustbowl, and the Johnson Art Museum print and photography collections.  Films include Gold Diggers of 1933, Stella Dallas, Sullivan's Travels, and Woody Allen's Radio Days.
VISST4770;;;Intermediate Film and Video Projects: Documentary;;;4;;;;;;;;;;;;PMA4570;;;Intensive course in 16mm filmmaking and digital video in which each student develops a significant documentary or experimental project both critically and creatively.
VISST4840;;;Contemporary Taiwanese Art;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(HA-AS);;;;;;ARTH4840;ARTH6840;ASIAN4484;ASIAN6684;;;Contemporary Taiwanese Art is defined in this course as the art of Taiwan since the 1980s. The 1980s was a crucial transformative period in Taiwan's history when the island underwent major social and political changes. Art as part of this transformation was fully engaged in reshaping the images of Taiwan, revealing moment-to-moment social reconstruction. With internationalization policies and the effects of globalization, the island has undergone further rapid and dramatic transformations since the 2000s. These changes are also revealed in works by younger generations of artists. In this research seminar, participants will select research topics at the beginning of the semester as their final research paper projects, and through weekly meetings, we will refine and delve into each selected topic deeply.
VISST4857;;;Producing Cloth Cultures;;;4;;;Spring.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ARTH4856;ARTH6856;;;It is a fundamental part of human activity to dress or cover one's body and environment. While the symbolic significance of such clothing has long been recognized, the activity of producing fabric itself deserves more attention. By this we do not only mean the various techniques and technological devices involved in spinning, weaving, stitching, or sewing, but also the analogical activities and metaphors they entailed. What stories did they tell? How did their connection to writing, remembering, lovemaking, or ruling one's kingdom, to name but a few examples, play out metaphorically in cloth? And how did fabrics depend on or transform the transmission of techniques, fashions and motives, but also gender, concepts of the body or the built environment?
VISST4860;;;Working Hot: Exploring Art Beyond Representation;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ARTH4860;ARTH6860;;;The sizzling hiss of white-hot iron plunged in water, the slap and punch required to put a hole  in a solid wad of clay on a kick-wheel, the whirring of a drop spindle in motion. Can we capture or theorize the creative process? What happens in the heat of the moment when artists engage with their materials? This seminar, part of the Johnson Museum of Art's Mellon Foundation initiative, will explore the terrains of art beyond representation. Engaging art production with museum practice, the course will be taught by associate professor, Kaja M. McGowan, and associate director &amp; Ames Curator of Education, Cathy Rosa Klimaszewski. Classes will be held at the museum, and in a number of designated workshops where artists engage in the heat of the moment.
VISST4945;;;Body Politics in African Literature and Cinema;;;4;;;Fall.;;;(CA-AS);;;;;;ASRC4995;ASRC6945;COML4945;COML6945;ENGL4741;FGSS4945;FGSS6945;LGBT4945;LGBT6945;VISST6945;;;The course examines how postcolonial African writers and filmmakers engage with and revise controversial images of bodies and sexuality-genital cursing, same-sex desire, HIV/AIDS, genital surgeries, etc. Our inquiry also surveys African theorists' troubling of problematic tropes and practices such as the conception in 19th-century racist writings of the colonized as embodiment, the pathologization and hypersexualization of colonized bodies, and the precarious and yet empowering nature of the body and sexuality in the postcolonial African experience. As we focus on African artists and theorists, we also read American and European theorists, including but not certainly limited to Giorgio Agamben, Michel Foucault, Roland Barthes, and Joseph Slaughter, detecting the ways in which discourses around bodies in the African context may shape contemporary theories and vice versa.
VISST4956;;;Pygmalion: Aesthetics of Touch;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;ARTH4956;CLASS4602;SHUM4997;;;"Please Do Not Touch" is one of the signs we are most accustomed to seeing in art museums, yet the very need to make this request demonstrates how objects often invite, seek, even demand that we transgress the limits of vision and engage with them physically. In the Pygmalion myth, the artist's creating hand and the viewer's desire to touch come together in a fantasy of union with the object that has been endlessly appropriated and reimagined in later Western culture. Focusing on Classical art, this course explores the role of touch and embodiment in the viewing and reception of art objects, drawing on ancient models of sense-perception as well as 20th Century theorists such as Reigl, Berenson and Merleau-Ponty.  
VISST4996;;;Perfection, Objectivity and Sensation in Philosophy of Art;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;CLASS4604;GERST4996;PHIL4596;SHUM4996;;;A graduate level discussion of the role of sensation in philosophy of art, and its relation to conceptions of objectivity and perfection. We'll aim to transform our understanding of a range of issues raised within traditional philosophy of art (for example, in the work of Plato, Aristotle, Aquinas, Hume, Kant, Nietzsche and Heidegger) by drawing upon relevant contemporary approaches in metaphysics, theory of knowledge and philosophy of mind.
VISST6174;;;Introduction to Film Analysis: Meaning and Value;;;4;;;Spring.;;;;;;;;;PMA2540;PMA6540;VISST2174;;;Intensive consideration of the ways films generate meaning and of the ways we attribute meaning and value to films. Discussion ranges over commercial narrative, documentary, and personal film modes. Graduate students who intend to teach film at the undergraduate level are especially welcome. In addition to full participation in the work of PMA 2540, graduate students read and discuss primary sources in film theory in weekly group tutorials.

VISST6500;;;Contemporary Aesthetic Theory and its Discontents;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;ARTH6510;COML6370;GERST6510;;;After having been reduced to a mere ideological formation of bourgeois origin, aesthetics has recently made a strong comeback in the field of theory. This course probes the reasons for this historical change. From the arguments of the critics we will derive a catalogue of criteria for a viable aesthetics in order to examine how contemporary aesthetic theory relates to cognitive theories, the historicity of art and taste (including specific practices and institutions), and the emancipatory potentials of ethics and politics. Readings may include Adorno, Berger, de Bolla, Bourdieu, Noel Carroll, Cavell, Danto, Derrida, Dickie, Eagleton, Goodman, Guillory, Gumbrecht, Halsall, Luhmann, Lyotard, de Man, Walter Benn Michaels, Obrist, Ohmann, Scarry, Seel, Shustermann, Barbara Herrnstein Smith, Williams and others.

VISST6965;;;Digital Discourse: Humanities, Art, Theory, Archive;;;4;;;Fall.;;;;;;;;;COML6932;ENGL6965;PMA6965;;;What is the relation of the theory and archival practice of the 'digital turn' to the overall question of the humanities? The course will consider a range of critical pressure points that have been central to the digital humanities and the production of new media art and theory. How have the developments of digital culture and theory impacted the critical commonplaces of archive, analogy, time, sound, motion, network, body, narrative? Does the destabilization of the archive by open source software and accumulative databases alter the conditions of academic research, the space of artistic practice, and the place of ideology critique?  How do recent trends in "media archeology" and "new materiality" correspond to or contrast with the virtuality of "new media" and the theoretical precedents of poststructuralism. In dialogue with critical paradigms that have been fundamental to the discourse of critical theory, from affect and trauma or aesthetics and archive, to colonialism and politics, sexuality and race, we will reflect on the parameters of a deeply significant archeological shift emphasized, if not wholly embodied, by the digital condition.
