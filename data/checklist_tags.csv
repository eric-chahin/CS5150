# File for defining the tagged logic
# 
# First:   Version
# Second:  The tag you are defining
# Third:   The number of credits it must be
# Fourth:  Course number it needs to be above
# Fifth:   The list of forbidden classes (separated with ';')
#
#   For the forbidden classes, a whole group of dept. classes can be forbidden 
#   with an asterisk after the dept name. (e.g. CS* means that all CS courses 
#   are forbidden)
#
#   Before listing checklist slots, start the version with "--" and a name for the version.
